0022MRWNZL,Plan now for higher risk of bird flu in winter,"Plan now for higher risk of bird flu in winter 
Poultry can become infected with bird flu viruses through direct contact with infected wild birds or their droppings. Wageningen Bioveterinary Research ( WBVR ) previously showed that the risk of introducing low pathogenic avian influenza viruses is higher for free-range poultry farms. In a recent study, WBVR examined whether this risk is greater at certain times of the year. 
For this study, data from the serological monitoring program for avian influenza was used, and eggs were collected from 261 runners for two years. In the monitoring program, blood samples from poultry are tested every three months for the presence of antibodies against bird flu. When antibodies were detected, the eggs - collected in the period prior to the detection of antibodies - were tested to determine the moment of introduction of the virus. Using mathematical and statistical models, the time of virus introduction and the time of year with higher risk of introductions were then calculated. 
Interventions focus on the winter period 
This study has shown that most releases of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses occur in the months of November through February. The same risk period was seen for the introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses. The risk of bird flu virus introduction to poultry farms during this period was four times higher than in the summer months. In winter, large numbers of migratory birds are present, which hibernate in our country. Interventions, also from agricultural entrepreneurs, aimed at preventing the introduction of avian influenza virus should therefore be particularly focused on in the winter period. Summary. 
The results of this study are mainly applicable to the Dutch situation and to free‐range layers in particular. We do not know whether the identified risk period, or presence of a distinct seasonal risk, would be similar in other European countries. The correlation observed between the risk period of introductions in poultry and the period of higher abundance of migratory waterfowl in the Netherlands might be used as correlate ( abundance of migratory waterfowl ) of seasonal risk that could be used to identify potential risk periods in neighboring countries. The results can be used to optimize risk‐based surveillance, take preventive measures in high‐risk months and inform decisions on timing and duration of indoor confinement during AI outbreaks in the Netherlands. Reduction in AI introductions into commercial poultry will benefit animal welfare, economy and public health.",#,https://thepoultrysite.com/news/2020/08/plan-now-for-higher-risk-of-bird-flu-in-winter,1596414726,2020-08-02 22:32:06+00:00,075a4e9c14,thepoultrysite.com
02NY20X4AK,Researchers assess live poultry trade factor in bird flu spread,"Researchers assess live poultry trade factor in bird flu spread 
BEIJING, March 3 ( Xinhua ) -- Researchers have figured out a new method for bird flu warning by studying the poultry trade network and virus transmission in China, according to a recent research article published in journal PNAS. 
The emergence and transmission of the bird flu, or avian influenza viruses ( AIVs ), posed a threat to public health. And the live poultry trade is thought to be a crucial factor in the spread of AIVs in Asia, said the article. 
The researchers hoped to find out the role of the poultry trade in disseminating AIVs over large geographic areas around the world, especially in developing countries. 
They combined virus genomes and reconstructed poultry transportation data to measure and compare the spatial spread in China of three main AIV subtypes of H5N1, H7N9, and H5N6. 
After analyzing large-scale genome sequences, they found evidence that AIV subtypes among the domestic poultry experienced contagious diffusion, which was likely associated with the intensity of the live poultry trade in China. 
The researchers also reported a regional-scale community structure in China that might explain the spread of AIV subtypes in the country. 
The identification of this structure has the potential to inform more targeted strategies for the prevention and control of AIVs in China.",#,http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2020-03/03/c_138839895.htm,1583235290,2020-03-03 10:34:50+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.xinhuanet.com
0358WRBFLA,Sticking together: how Irish free-range egg farmers are navigating the bird flu outbreak,"Sticking together: how Irish free-range egg farmers are navigating the bird flu outbreak 
According to reporting in Agriland, poultry farmers in Ireland are operating in a `` high-stress '' environment. A number of flocks have been impacted by a recent spate of bird flu infections, and many free-range egg producers say they feel `` underrepresented '' in official decisions made about their own livelihoods. 

To respond to these challenges, Agriland reports that a number of producers have created their own representative and advocacy group. The group wants to help free-range egg producers, `` navigate the challenges, uncertainties and general queries, '' they may have. The group is based on supporting and informing fellow farmers. 

The main aim of the group is to address the fears many producers have of avian influenza. Brendan Soden, the chair of the group said, `` [ we ] have a Whats. 
App group with around 120 free-range egg producers where everyone can keep each other informed on what's going on. If there was an outbreak of bird flu in a producer's area, we have a tool as a way of notifying them now. '' 

Soden told Agriland that many producers are concerned about the financial burdens of losing a flock to avian influenza. 

`` As far as I am aware, there is no long-term of continuous scheme for compensation for us producers if we suffer financially form bird flu and it does n't look like there will be in the future ... We have basically been looking to our own to look after us, with little help from industry. We are underrepresented and, therefore, do n't have those in industry helping us, '' he said.",#,https://thepoultrysite.com/news/2020/07/sticking-together-how-irish-free-range-egg-farmers-are-navigating-the-bird-flu-outbreak,1594800897,2020-07-15 06:14:57+00:00,075a4e9c14,thepoultrysite.com
03O5W3LFYT,"COVID-19: Price competitive poultry “least impacted in economic slowdown,” says Rabobank","COVID-19: Price competitive poultry `` least impacted in economic slowdown, '' says Rabobank 
23 Mar 2020 -- In a new Rabobank analysis, the outlook for global poultry in 2020 will be materially affected by the current coronavirus pandemic. Even during the economic slowdown, poultry demand may yet stand to benefit among other animal-based proteins due to its price competitiveness. Meanwhile, a further drop in Asian pork production due to African swine fever ( ASF ) is expected this year, which the report outlines could lead to potential growth in local poultry production and international trade if rising supply chain challenges can be managed. `` It's very difficult to assess how long this will take and depends of course on how much further and how long the coronavirus will spread further. In our view, this will affect poultry trade further at least in Q1/Q2 and possibly longer, '' Nan-Dirk Mulder, Senior Global Specialist -- Animal Protein at Rabobank, tells Food. 
IngredientsFirst. `` In terms of markets, we expect more at-home poultry consumption and higher sales of non-perishable poultry products. Labor availability and logistics issues, such as those impacting distribution, will likely affect supply in the coming months. Coronavirus will also affect the global supply of poultry inputs, such as feed additives and animal health products, due to disruptions with Chinese and other suppliers, '' he explains. From a global demand perspective, the Rabobank report underscores that poultry is generally the least-impacted protein in a global economic slowdown, primarily due to its price competitiveness. The spread of COVID-19, however, adds further uncertainties to an already volatile market faced with the outbreak of avian influenza. `` Volatility is driven by the ongoing impact of ASF and reductions in global pork production, avian influenza outbreaks in Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as some potential trade disruptions, '' says Mulder. `` Trade issues include Brexit, the US-China trade agreement, new trade restrictions in the Middle East, but also the opening of trade between the US and EU and some Asian countries. '' Click to Enlarge. 
The report notes that poultry is the least-impacted protein in a global economic slowdown given its price competitiveness. Impacts of ASF and avian influenzaASF and avian influenza are flagged by Rabobank as two main factors that push up market volatility. ASF notably contributed to a protein shortage in China, which has led to the culling of millions of hogs in the past year. The outbreak will remain a major driver of volatility in poultry markets, with increasing import demand in countries like China and potential supply shocks in local markets like Vietnam and the Philippines. Global poultry markets are currently affected by a new wave of avian influenza outbreaks, which typically spreads in Northern Hemisphere winters. Eastern Europe has been most affected, especially Poland, Romania, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Hungary and Ukraine. As Poland and Ukraine are major global traders, it also affects global markets, details the Rabobank analysis. In Poland, the industry can refocus trade towards the big intra-EU market. For Ukraine, the many avian influenza-related trade restrictions can only be offset by increasing sales in the local market or by reducing production until trade is restored. Meanwhile, Asian markets, like China, Taiwan, Vietnam and Saudi Arabia have been hit by avian influenza outbreaks. This will impact local market conditions this year, especially due to the impact of culling, but with a more limited impact on trade. Last November, China decided to lift its four-year ban on poultry imports from the US, signaling new trade opportunities for North American chicken. The ban was first enforced by China in 2015 following an outbreak of avian influenza, which has since been the focal point of trade negotiations between Beijing and Washington DC. Click to Enlarge. 
The world's top-performing poultry markets are currently Brazil and Thailand. Top performing poultry markets. 
The world's top-performing poultry markets are currently Brazil and Thailand, while the EU, Indonesia, South Africa, and Mexico are currently in recovery mode, highlights Rabobank's report. The weakest performing markets are the US ( with `` big oversupply '' ), India, and China, with the latter expected to improve later this year. Trade agreements and restrictions are still shaking up global trade volumes, the analysis reveals. On one hand, trade liberalization via US-China and EU-Vietnam agreements will bump up trade, as restrictions on trade in Saudi Arabia, and potentially South Africa and the UK, could present challenges. The global trade of poultry will face more volatility this year, with both destinations and origins affected, as well as pricing, reports Rabobank. Total volumes are likely to be affected temporarily due to COVID-19. As read in previous Food.

Takamatsu, Kagawa Pref., Nov. 13 ( Jiji Press ) -- Another case of bird flu infections has been confirmed in Kagawa Prefecture, western Japan, the prefectural government said Friday. 
The latest case is the fourth in Japan this year. The previous three cases were also detected in Kagawa. 
The fourth case occurred at a chicken farm in the city of Mitoyo. On Thursday, the prefectural government received a report of an increase in dead chickens at the farm. Bird flu infections were then confirmed in simplified tests. 
Through a gene test on Friday, the strain of bird flu found at the farm was found likely to be highly pathogenic. 
The prefectural government plans to cull about 10,000 chickens at the farm. It has instructed other chicken farms within 10 kilometers to restrict shipments of chickens and eggs outside the area.

Isolated in the deserts 
The farms free of avian flu are in the deserts. The isolated establishments system is an international mechanism recommended by the OEI to allow countries to export their poultry products, provided the facilities are free of epidemics. A total of 14 poultry facilities belonging to 8 of Egypt's largest poultry firms, which have implemented epidemiological and biosecurity measures, have requested approval. According to the Minster of Agriculture and Land Reclamation, al-Sayed al-Qaseir, poultry firms have achieved self-sufficiency in poultry and eggs, and establishing giant projects in desert areas aims to increase investments and the efficiency of farms, Egypt Independent reports.

0AB2H1H1GV,Avian flu restrictions come into play Monday,"OWNERS of free-range poultry and other captive birds in Cumbria will have to house them from Monday, to protect against bird flu.

 Cumbria Trading Standards are advising poultry keepers about the new measures that come into force at the start of next week, saying they must follow strict biosecurity measures in order to limit the spread of and eradicate the disease.

 Extra precautions, such as cleaning and disinfecting equipment, clothing and vehicles, limiting access to non-essential people on their sites, and workers changing clothing and footwear before entering bird enclosures, must be taken.

 A Trading Standards statement said that everyone must remain vigilant for any signs of disease in their birds and any wild birds and seek prompt advice from their vet if they have any concerns.

 They can help prevent avian flu by maintaining good biosecurity on their premises, including:

 n Housing or netting all poultry and captive birds

 n Cleansing and disinfecting clothing, footwear, equipment and vehicles before and after contact with poultry and captive birds – if practical, use disposable protective clothing

 n Reducing the movement of people, vehicles or equipment to and from areas where poultry and captive birds are kept, to minimise contamination from manure, slurry and other products, and using effective vermin control

 n Thoroughly cleaning and disinfecting housing at the end of a production cycle

 n Keeping fresh disinfectant at the right concentration at all points where people should use it, such as farm entrances and before entering poultry and captive bird housing or enclosures

 n Minimising direct and indirect contact between poultry and captive birds and wild birds, including making sure all feed and water is not accessible to wild birds.

 Public health advice is that the risk to human health from the virus is very low and food standards bodies advise that avian influenzas pose a very low food safety risk for UK consumers, and it does not affect the consumption of poultry products, including eggs.

 The new housing measures will be from 14 December onwards and will be kept under regular review as part of the government’s work to protect flocks.

 Poultry and captive bird keepers and members of the public should report dead wild birds to the Defra helpline on 03459 33 55 77 (option 7), and keepers should report suspicion of disease to APHA on 03000 200 301.",#,https://www.nwemail.co.uk/news/18938968.avian-flu-restrictions-come-play-monday/,1607749200,2020-12-12 04:00:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.nwemail.co.uk
0AZ77BCEK1,What is Bird flu,"What is Bird flu 
Bird flu or avian influenza is a viral infection that infects not just birds but also humans and other animals. There are different types of bird flu depending on the subtypes of viruses that attack you. Scientists have identified more than a dozen types of bird flu causing viruses, but the two most common strains are H5N1 and H7N9. Although, the influenza virus that causes bird flu rarely infects humans, but when it does it can turn fatal. The first case of avian influenza that affected the human population was caused by H5N1 virus in Hong Kong in 1997. After this incident, several other cases of bird flu were reported in Hong Kong, China, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Egypt. Since 1997, less than 500 bird flu deaths have been listed to the World Health Organization ( WHO ). Outbreaks of avian influenza have occurred in Asia, Africa, North America and different parts of Europe. During this phase, it was observed that people who had close contact with sick birds got infected by the influenza virus.",North America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/health-fitness/health-a-z/bird-flu/diseasearticle/74283902.cms,1582542254,2020-02-24 10:04:14+00:00,075a4e9c14,timesofindia.indiatimes.com
0BI3STFL6M,Epidemiologist Warns Congress that U.S.-China Tensions Harm Collaboration on Coronavirus Epidemic,"Epidemiologist Warns Congress that U.S.-China Tensions Harm Collaboration on Coronavirus Epidemic 
Feb. 17, 2020 ( EIRNS ) -- Jennifer Bouey, senior policy researcher at the RAND Corporation and George Washington University professor, outlined to the House Foreign Affairs Committee's Asia subcommittee Feb. 5 hearing on the coronavirus, the great benefits which U.S.-China collaboration on developing China's public health capabilities have made to the battle against global virus threats. Bouey warned, however, that the weakened collaboration on health matters between the two as a result of today's increased tensions, has real consequences for fighting the current novel coronavirus epidemic. 
When the SARS virus hit China in 2003, China had neither a national center for disease control nor a national case-reporting system, nor could any physician or journalist alert the public of any infectious outbreak before the Ministry of Health announced it, Bouey reported in her written testimony. Faced with its unpreparedness, China shook up its approach to domestic and global health. China's Ministry of Health signed a multi-year partnership with the U.S. Health and Human Services Department in October 2003, to build up China's public health infrastructure. Under the agreement, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and the Chinese National Influenza Center ( CNIC ) worked together in 2004 to develop China's influenza technical expertise and surveillance capabilities, so that it could deal with the outbreak of the H5N1 avian flu virus. 
When the H1N1 swine flu then hit Mexico and the United States in 2009, American and Chinese authorities shared information and technology to fight the virus, and China became the first country to mass-produce an H1N1 vaccine. 
In 2010, China's CNIC, which by then included 408 laboratories and 553 sentinel hospitals, was designated the fifth WHO Collaborating Center for Reference and Research on Influenza. The CNIC began testing more than 20,000 influenza viruses annually and training other countries on influenza control. 
In 2013, U.S.-China collaboration proved key in the outbreak of the highly-mortal H7N9 avian flu ( with a 30 % fatality rate ) in China, and again in 2014, with the outbreak of the even more fatal Ebola epidemic in West Africa. U.S. and Chinese medical teams collaborated on the ground in Africa, and in 2015, held a U.S.-China Symposium on Ebola, Research, and Global Health Security, hosted by the U.S. National Institutes of Health ( NIH ). 
In the last three years of tensions, however, collaborative meetings have stalled; NIH and CDC staff based in Beijing have been reduced; the U.S. closed its National Science Foundation office in Beijing; China has enacted legislation restricting foreign NGO activities. 
Bouey urged the Congress and administration to use the coronavirus crisis to turn this around. Rather than stigmas and punitive remarks, she proposed that the U.S. CDC work with China's CDC and the China International Development Cooperation Agency, to map out potential collaboration on helping countries which do not have health care systems capable of stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus, or COVID-19.",West Africa,https://larouchepub.com/pr/2020/200217_epidemic.html,1581926400,2020-02-17 07:00:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,larouchepub.com

The veterinary service has stood by its report that ducks which have been dying at Salina been tested positive for Influenza A subtype H6 ( avian flu ). 
Times of Malta reported on Monday that the Commissioner for animal rights had launched an investigation into the deaths after a privately commissioned report contradicted the first findings of the state veterinarian. 
But the Veterinary Regulation Directorate stood by its findings on Tuesday, saying that confirmatory tests were carried out by the EU reference laboratory ( EURL ). 
It said most of the feral waterfowl have been relocated to a secure place and efforts are being made to try to relocate the remaining birds. Further testing is also being carried out. 
People were asked not to move any remaining birds to other sites without its official approval. 
The directorate had reported earlier this month that the ducks were infected with avian flu and salmonella and could pose a threat to other wildlife in the area as well as the local food chain due to the possibility of transmission of disease through poultry. 
However, a private report commissioned to investigate the cause of death of the ducks did not find avian flu or salmonella in the animals tested. 
The private report, authored by veterinarian Catherine Portelli, said there were no signs of respiratory diseases in the ducks and that it was likely they died of poisoning or gastrointestinal disease.

0CKHXBFS4F,Non-notifiable avian influenza discovered in Monaghan flock,"Non-notifiable avian influenza discovered in Monaghan flock 
The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has confirmed the identification of a `` low pathogenic avian influenza of the H6N1 sub-type in a commercial poultry flock '' in Co.. Monaghan. 
According to a statement from the department: `` This sub-type of avian influenza is not a notifiable disease and has no known public health risk nor international trade implications. 
`` Movement of poultry and poultry products onto and from the farm were subject to restriction whilst an investigation into the disease episode was underway. 
Movement restrictions currently remain in place as a precautionary measure to mitigate against the spread of this disease to other locations. 
The department will be liaising with the flock-owner with a view to minimising the risk of disease spreading from his farm, the statement outlined. 
In addition to this flock, the department is investigating two more flocks in the Monaghan area for avian influenza. 
In both cases the presenting clinical signs and preliminary laboratory results are such that low pathogenic H6N1 is likely to be the disease agent involved, according to the statement. 
Similar outbreaks of low-pathogenic H6N1 avian influenza have been identified in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England over recent weeks. 
The situation has been described as `` a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring high standards of biosecurity in poultry flocks ''. 
The department urges all poultry owners -- including backyard flock owners -- to be vigilant and to implement strict biosecurity on their premises, particularly by ensuring only essential personnel, vehicles and equipment have access to their flocks and minimising contact between poultry and wild birds. 
Flock-owners should regularly monitor their birds for signs of disease, the department has advised. 
If they suspect avian influenza, they must report it immediately to their veterinarian or to one of the department's Regional Veterinary Offices. 
It should be noted that there has also been a number of outbreaks of the notifiable H5N8 strain of avian influenza in Central Europe and the number of outbreaks has been steadily increasing in the last few weeks, with outbreaks now reported in seven countries. 
Concluding, the department reminded poultry owners that anyone who keeps poultry, even only one or two birds, in Ireland must register their premises with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.","Northern Ireland, Centeral Europe",https://www.agriland.ie/farming-news/non-notifiable-avian-influenza-discovered-in-monaghan-flock/,1583746440,2020-03-09 08:34:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.agriland.ie

0F9W1GRIGH,Bird flu concerns persist in sector 16 December 2020 Free,"Bird flu continues to threaten the poultry industry on the island of Ireland. The confirmed outbreak last week among a small turkey flock in Wicklow is the latest confirmation of bird flu on this island. The advice is clear – flock owners are asked to keep visitors to an absolute minimum and to maintain a visitors’ book that includes contact details and previous sites visited, as well as what sites they are going to next. Visitors should also wear protective clothing and be given access to foot dip and hand washing facilities. According to chair of the Ulster Farmers Union poultry committee Ronnie Wells (page 48), bird flu, the biggest risk to the industry, comes from poultry keepers with backyard or hobby flocks. He maintains that a lot of these people don’t realise that if they had food sitting outside for their hens, a wild bird with avian influenza could fly down and leave its droppings nearby. This can then potentially be spread to other farms and could devastate the industry. Differentiating productsHow to differentiate poultry products is a debate among poultry producers, similar to the dairy and beef sectors at the moment. On page 50, UCD’s Patrick Wall discusses some of the issues that help marketing and the attributes of eggs and chicken meat that can assist in differentiating the product from other sources of protein. Similarly, the UFU poultry committee is seeking guarantees from retailers that barn eggs will have a long-term market, free-range products will command a premium and that the lower-tier egg market will not be served by cheap imports (see page 49).The rising price of poultry feed is going to impact margins on poultry farms over the coming months. While many poultry producers will have forward purchased, producers will still feel the effects at some stage in the future. Research has shown that where the pig or poultry sectors are concerned, we are not competitive on feed prices, so efficiency and minimising waste are essential.

0G46I0SIR3,"At least 25 bird carcasses found so far at Tau Devi Biodiversity Park, bird flu suspected","Carcasses of at least 25 birds have been found at the Tau Devi Biodiversity Park over the past few days, officials of the wildlife department said on Sunday, amid growing concerns over an outbreak of avian influenza virus (AIV).Officials said that the increasing bird deaths in the city, especially at the biodiversity park, are most likely due to avian influenza. The carcasses of the birds were buried at the biodiversity park and samples sent for testing.During a spot visit to the park in Sector 56 on Sunday afternoon, a Hindustan Times team was able to spot at least five carcasses in the park, including those of three crows, a myna and an egret. The team also came upon two crows that appeared sickly and unable to move.Wildlife officials confirmed that a higher incidence of bird mortality has indeed been reported from Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity park, particularly among crows.“In the last two to three days alone, some 25 dead birds have been retrieved and buried at Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park, to prevent any further spread of bird flu. Almost all are crows, with one or two mynas and egrets. Even though confirmatory results from the lab in Jalandhar are yet to come, bird flu seems to be the likeliest cause of death. We are now keeping a very close eye on Sultanpur, Basai and Najafgarh wetlands for anything out of the ordinary, but there has been no unusual activity there so far among local or migrant birds,” said Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector.The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), which maintains the Tau Devi Lal Biodiversity Park, erected signboards at the park’s entrance on Sunday that read: “A lot of birds are dying in the park because of bird flu. Please be cautious for your own safety.”Subash Yadav, a metropolitan green planner with the GMDA, also said that footfall in the park decreased sharply over the past week. “The park was the emptiest it has been on a Sunday in several months. Walkers and joggers make up a huge portion of the crowd, but there is reluctance due to the bird flu scare. If the lab report confirms the presence of AIV, we will shut the park to walkers for a few days.”However, officials also said that any confirmation of bird flu in Gurugram will still take at least another two weeks. “The Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab (RDDL) in Jalandhar is processing samples from all over the country, so the test results will take some time to arrive. In fact, the RDDL’s backlog of samples is so much that we have stopped conducting RT-PCR tests there for Covid-19 so that these bird flu samples can be cleared first,” an official of the animal husbandry department said, requesting anonymity.Meanwhile, 11 rapid response teams conducted clinical surveillance of poultry farms on Sunday but did not find any sign of an avian influenza outbreak. “I cannot say much except that we have not seen anything unusual with the health of poultry. We are on the lookout. Our field teams have been in constant touch with poultry farmers. Nothing is out of the ordinary there,” said the official cited above.

The case is a 3-year-old female from Zhuhai, Guangdong Province, China, who had a history of environmental exposure to domestic poultry before onset of symptom. She had mild illness and no symptoms have been detected in her contacts. 
In 2020, there are three cases reported so far, two from China and one from India. A total of 30 cases of human infection with avian influenza A ( H9N2 ) in China have been reported since December 2015. 
In most human cases of H9N2 avian flu, the associated disease symptoms have been mild and there has been no evidence of human-to-human transmission. Influenza A ( H9N2 ) viruses are enzootic in poultry populations in parts of Africa, Asia and the Middle East. 
Most human cases are exposed to the A ( H9N2 ) virus through contact with infected poultry or contaminated environments. Human infection tends to result in mild clinical illness. Since the virus continues to be detected in poultry populations, further human cases can be expected.

0HY8UO15WP,African swine fever spreads near the German border: OIE,"African swine fever spreads near the German border: OIE 
PARIS ( Reuters ) - Poland recorded 55 outbreaks of African swine fever in wild boar near the German border last month, the world animal health body said on Thursday, in a sign the deadly virus is spreading near one of the European Union's biggest pork exporters. 
A report posted on the World Organization for Animal Health ( OIE ) website showed that the disease, which has devastated herds in the world's top pork producer China, had now been found in a village less than 30 kilometres ( 18.6 miles ) from Germany. 
African swine fever is harmless to humans but highly deadly in boars and pigs. It originated in Africa before spreading to Europe and Asia and has already killed hundreds of million pigs, while reshaping global meat and feed markets. 
Germany's government said early December it was stepping up measures to prevent an outbreak of African swine fever after a case was discovered in Poland close to its border. 
A majority of the outbreaks reported by the Polish farm ministry to the OIE were discovered between Dec. 4 and Dec. 23 in neighboring villages in the states of Lubuskie and Wielkopolskie, 75 to 100 km from the German border. 
There are fears in Germany that its exports of pork to China and other Asian countries could be threatened, with import bans regularly imposed on pig meat from regions where African swine fever has been discovered. 
Authorities in German states bordering Poland have built fences in an attempt to stop wild boars wandering into Germany and spreading the disease. 
A series of 90 cm high fences similar to those used to close farm fields were built by the state of Brandenburg in December while the state also relaxed hunting restrictions to allow more shooting of boar, the state agriculture ministry said. 
The state of Saxony said it is this week building a 4.5 km electrified fence along a high risk sector close to the border with Poland. 
Countries infected by severe animal diseases such as African swine fever or highly pathogenic bird flu, must warn the OIE immediately and submit regular follow-up reports.

Tehran, 2 July 2020 -- The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has delivered necessary supplies to strengthen the influenza response of the national influenza centre in the Islamic Republic of Iran. 
While fully engaged in providing emergency support for the fight against the COVID-19 outbreak in the country, WHO continues to further strengthen its support for the national influenza programme. The WHO shipment including laboratory supplies for influenza testing by real time PCR and viral isolation was delivered to the national influenza centre to prepare the country for the upcoming winter season. 
The centre serves as the key point of contact between WHO and the country on all matters relating to epidemiological and virological aspects of influenza. It is well equipped with molecular and cellular biology technologies to conduct virus isolation, genomic sequencing, and cloning, through which determines the common virus strains circulating in the country. The isolates are then sent to the WHO Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System ( GISRS ) to be used in the annual influenza vaccine after confirmation. 
The centre alerts the WHO Global Influenza Programme on any influenza isolate that can not be readily identified using reagents provided by WHO and immediately submits the isolate to the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza. In addition to influenza, other viral respiratory infections, such as measles and rubella, are being studied in the laboratory. 
The centre was approved to join the WHO GISRS in 1969. In 2005, after an outbreak of bird flu in some countries, health authorities in the Islamic Republic of Iran focused more heavily on the medical and economic impact of influenza and expanded the laboratory as part of the Virology Department of the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences.

0LIERN65K2,EU on alert for new avian influenza outbreaks this Autumn,"EUROPE HAS been urged to step up surveillance and biosecurity measures to guard against possible new outbreaks of avian influenza.

 The warning follows outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) among wild and domestic birds in western Russia and Kazakhstan over the past few months.

 The last times HPAI was detected in these areas in 2005 and 2016, epidemics followed in Northern and eastern Europe following autumn migration.

 If the pattern is repeated this year, HPAI is expected to arrive in the same areas of Europe in autumn or winter with subsequent spread to countries in southern and western Europe also possible.

 EU countries are encouraged to take measures to detect suspected cases of HPAI promptly and increase biosecurity measures at poultry farms. They are also urged to warn veterinary and wildlife health authorities of the likely risk of HPAI introduction, and urge them to carry out observation and prompt testing of dead or sick wild birds.

 Spread of the virus is likely to be triggered by a sudden and persistent fall in temperatures in central Russia and Kazakhstan. Several studies demonstrate that cold weather conditions led to the rapid westward expansion of the HPAI virus by infected migratory birds during the 2005-2006 and 2016-2017 waves.

 The risk of transmission of avian influenza viruses to the general public in Europe remains very low. However, to minimise the risk of transmission to humans, people are advised not to not touch dead birds without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment.",Eastern Europe,https://www.thescottishfarmer.co.uk/news/18770980.eu-alert-new-avian-influenza-outbreaks-autumn/,1601910000,2020-10-05 13:00:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.thescottishfarmer.co.uk

0OPIVPRFFH,Centre’s Wildlife Division issues guidelines to States on containing avian flu,"The Environment Ministry’s wildlife division has written to States to take “all possible steps” to contain the spread of avian flu.These include stepping up surveillance and monitoring of the birds. Currently States send tissue samples of birds suspected to harbour the virus to the ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal. Samples from Himachal Pradesh were confirmed positive for H5N1 avian influenza, says a Ministry note dated January 4.Avian flu sees periodic cycles in India but so far has not seen the causative virus jump onto people and be transmissible. “Large number of migratory birds visit India in this season. Movement of birds to wetlands is also possible. It is requested to keep strict vigil on the wintering habits of migratory birds, including wetlands, for any mortality or disease outbreak signs,” the wildlife division circular issued late on Tuesday notes.However, the note says, the guidelines issued are “generic “ in nature. Thus workers involved in culling operations should wear rubber gloves and protective clothing that can be disinfected or disposed of, use protective eyewear and ought to be taking an influenza antiviral drug daily for the time that they are in direct contact with infected birds or in a containment zone.

0Q6TYL25BR,Bird flu present in a quarter of Japan’s prefectures,"Reuters reports that the spread of bird flu in Japan has led to mass poultry cullings. 
About 32,000 birds will be slaughtered and buried in Sukumo city in Kochi prefecture in southwestern Japan after avian influenza was discovered at an egg farm, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday 16 December.

More infected birds were found on two farms in Kagawa prefecture, where the poultry epidemic emerged last month, with nearly 30,000 birds being slaughtered there, the ministry said.

The outbreak has hit 12 prefectures across Japan and a record 3 million birds have been culled to date.

While the ministry said it is not possible for people to catch avian influenza from eating the eggs or meat of infected chickens, health officials around the world are concerned about the virus strain making a ""species jump"" to humans and causing a pandemic like the novel coronavirus.

The outbreak in Japan and neighbouring South Korea is one of two separate highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemics hitting poultry around the world, according the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and Japanese officials.

Both the strain circulating in Asia and one spreading rapidly in Europe originated in wild birds, they said.

Japan has an egg-laying flock of about 185 million hens and a broiler population of 138 million, according to the ministry of agriculture.

Farms in Japan were earlier ordered to disinfect facilities and check hygiene regimes, as well as to ensure that nets to keep out wild birds are installed properly.","South Korea, southwestern Japan",https://www.thepoultrysite.com/news/2020/12/bird-flu-present-in-a-quarter-of-japans-prefectures,1608105600,2020-12-16 07:00:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.thepoultrysite.com

ZHAMBYL, Kazakhstan -- Kazakhstan has locked down one more village over an outbreak of bird flu. 

The chief of the Veterinary Directorate in the southern Zhambyl region, Erbol Zhienqulov, said on September 29 that the village of Qaratas had been locked down after cases of bird flu were confirmed at a local poultry farm on September 21. 

According to Zhienqulov, the quarantine in the village will last for three weeks. He said that no bird flu among humans was registered. 

Zhienqulov added that 60,000 domestic birds were vaccinated for bird flu after hundreds of chickens, geese, and turkeys died en masse earlier this month. 

Kazakhstan's Agriculture Ministry said a bird flu outbreak was detected in the North Kazakhstan region that borders with Russia earlier this month.

0TQ2GHSGW3,"Meat and Coronavirus: Facts, Myths, What to Know","Meat and Coronavirus: Facts, Myths, What to Know 
What's the link between meat and the coronavirus? As the outbreak of the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) grips the world, more and more people are isolating, quarantining, and wondering just how we got here. PETA has long warned about the health risks associated with eating meat. After all, raising animals for food in filthy conditions is a breeding ground for diseases that can be transmitted to humans.PETA has answers to common questions about the link between eating meat and the coronavirus: Can I get COVID-19 from eating meat? The World Health Organization says, `` To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals. Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products. '' For animals, the environment, and your own health, going vegan is your safest bet. Yes, even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides. Is it safe to eat meat during the coronavirus outbreak? You should stay away from animal-derived foods at all times for many reasons! They include the following: Is the meat industry responsible for the coronavirus? We ca n't ignore the link between meat and outbreaks of diseases like COVID-19. Humans ' insatiable demand for meat, eggs, and dairy means that huge numbers of animals are reared in intensive confinement in giant, filthy warehouses. Chickens, cows, pigs, and other animals are crammed together in small cages or feces-ridden sheds. They 're transported in filthy trucks and slaughtered on killing floors soaked with blood, urine, and other bodily fluids. Pathogens flourish in such conditions. Crowded farms are a breeding ground for new strains of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Where did the coronavirus come from? Public health experts believe COVID-19 originated at a `` wet market '' in China, where vendors sell both live and dead animals for human consumption. COVID-19 is similar to the outbreaks of SARS and MERS: All three spread from animals to humans. Have other diseases come from eating meat? According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, `` Approximately 75 percent of recently emerging infectious diseases affecting people began as diseases in animals. '' Swine flu -- which is linked to pigs -- has killed thousands of people worldwide. And bird flu ( or avian flu ) is a disease that can spread easily on a crowded chicken farm. There are at least 144 different strains of bird flu. The H5N1 variety kills the most birds and is deadly to humans, killing about 60 % of those who catch it. © Jo-Anne Mc. 
Arthur / We Animals. 
Slaughtered chicken hangs off the edge of stall table in a Taipei wet market. What is the meat industry's role in the emergence of superbugs? In addition to serving as breeding grounds for viruses, the crowded, filthy conditions on farms allow bacteria to spread quickly. Farmers feed animals on today's farms a regimen of antibiotics to try to minimize sickness or to promote unnatural growth. Did you know that animals on farms consume more antibiotics every year than humans do? Bacteria become resistant to antibiotics as a result of overuse. This contributes to the emergence of `` superbugs '' -- new, aggressive pathogens. Now, the drugs used to keep animals on farms alive are making humans sick. Need Help Going Vegan? We 've Got You Covered.

0V0DM8WSD7,"Close slaughterhouses until workers can be tested, appeals PETA India","Close slaughterhouses until workers can be tested, appeals PETA India 

New Delhi, June 9 ( IANSlife ) In a letter sent to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, animal-rights organisation People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals ( PETA ) India has urged the closure of all licensed slaughterhouses, at least until a suitable daily COVID-19 testing programme is in place for workers. 

The group has also appealed to the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India to make daily COVID-19 testing of workers a mandatory part of slaughterhouse registration. 
The body notes that `` slaughterhouses around the world are hotbeds of COVID-19 infections, since maintaining the recommended social distancing among workers is nearly impossible inside them. Recent figures show that in the US, 15,000 slaughterhouse and meat-processing plant employees have COVID-19 and at least 60 workers have died. It was also recently reported that in Europe, more than 1,000 slaughterhouses employees have COVID-19. As the number of cases increases in these facilities, the workers spread the disease to their families and in their communities. '' 
Keeping this in mind, PETA India has also asked for the permanent closure of all unlicensed slaughterhouses. 
The group pointed out that many slaughterhouses in India lack suitable basic facilities, such as ample water, proper cleaning supplies, adequate drainage, and effective waste disposal. Staff spend their days surrounded by blood, faeces, urine, and associated pathogens, often without wearing shoes or any protective gear. 
`` If COVID-19 spreads like wildfire through blood-soaked slaughterhouses, as it has in other countries, workers will become major transmitters of the disease to their families and communities. No one should be in a filthy slaughterhouse right now - not the workers or the terrified animals whose throats are slit for meat that nobody needs, '' observes PETA India Vegan Outreach Coordinator Dr Kiran Ahuja. 

Since COVID-19 is overwhelmingly believed by scientists to have jumped from animals to humans at a live-animal market in China - along with previous infectious diseases like SARS, swine flu, and bird flu also traced back to animals used for meat - the animal-rights body said slaughterhouse workers are already at risk for zoonotic diseases ( illnesses of animal origin ) like brucellosis, leptospirosis, and Q fever.

The Trump administration is trying to whip the country into an anti-Chinese frenzy because the novel coronavirus might have been accidentally transmitted from a laboratory rather than a wet market. But surely the larger question we should be asking is why we have been seeing viruses jump from animals to humans with such frequency in recent years. SARS, MERS, Ebola, bird flu and swine flu all started as viruses in animals and then jumped to humans, unleashing deadly outbreaks. Why? 
Peter Daszak is a disease ecologist and renowned `` virus hunter. '' He ventures into bat caves in full protective gear to get the animals ' saliva or blood to determine the origins of a virus. During a conversation with me, he was clear: `` We are doing things every day that make pandemics more likely. We need to understand, this is not just nature. It is what we are doing to nature. '' 
Remember, most viruses come from animals. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that three-quarters of new human diseases originate in animals.

Impact of COVID-19 on food security and agriculture 
• Despite a slight improvement in recent years, hunger remains prevalent in most provinces of the Philippines. 
• The country's agriculture sector has been affected by pests and diseases such as African swine fever ( ASF ), avian influenza, and fall armyworm ( FAW ), as well as by natural disasters, the most recent being Typhoon Vongfong which hit the Philippines in mid - May at the height of the COVID-19 crisis. The Typhoon affected agricultural production, especially high-value crops, as well as rice, corn, assorted vegetables, livestock and fisheries including fish stock, facilities and equipment. 
• Preliminary results of a rapid assessment conducted jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development ( IFAD ) indicate that the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and related restriction measures have contributed to aggravating existing challenges in the Philippines ' agri-food system -- both short-term stresses ( such as ASF, FAW and typhoons ) as well as long term issues. The latter includes the weak growth and low income of producers, farm labour shortages, lack of producers ' access to inputs and financing, high costs of logistics and storage, a disconnected value chain, high cost of nutritious food, vulnerability of the agriculture sector to environmental hazards, and reliance of the existing food system on concentrated distribution points such as urban centres. 
• The effects of government restrictions related to COVID-19 also contributed to a substantial increase in unemployment and underemployment rates, negatively affecting household incomes, particularly for smallholders and landless labourers, as well as causing food accessibility issues, especially for vulnerable populations in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao ( BARMM ). The effects of COVID-19 containment measures also contributed to reduced productivity and disruptions in the flow of goods ( including food products and other essential items ) for small and medium enterprises in the food-manufacturing sector. 
• The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may have also triggered new problems for the agri-food sector. Surveys conducted by the National Economic and Development Authority showed that the agriculture sector lost an estimated PHP 94.3 million ( about USD 1.9 million ) from unsold produce, with the regions of Calabarzon and Central Luzon accounting for 27.9 percent and 26.3 percent of the losses, respectively. About 39 percent of the total losses were in high-value crops. Overall, losses across agriculture, industry and service sectors amounted to PHP 1.1 billion ( around USD 21.8 million ), or about 5.6 percent of the country's gross domestic product.",#,https://reliefweb.int/report/philippines/philippines-revised-humanitarian-response-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-may,1594913400,2020-07-16 13:30:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,reliefweb.int

The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has confirmed the identification of avian influenza in a commercial poultry flock in Co.. Monaghan while three other flocks in the county are also being investigated. Retailers in the west have been advised by one Galway-based egg supplier that their producer has reported an outbreak of the virus on their farm. 
Shops have been told: `` We regret to inform you that our main egg supplier has bird flu. As a result of this, there will be a shortage of eggs. '' According to the Department: `` This subtype of avian influenza is not a notifiable disease and has no known public health risk nor international trade implications. Movement of poultry and poultry products onto and from the farm were subject to restriction whilst an investigation into the disease episode was underway. '' A spokesperson for the Department added: `` Movement restrictions currently remain in place as a precautionary measure to mitigate against the spread of this disease to other locations. The Department will be liaising with the flock-owner with a view to minimising the risk of disease spread from his farm. '' 
The Department has also confirmed that three more flocks in the Monaghan area are being investigated for avian influenza. `` In these cases, the presenting clinical signs and preliminary laboratory results are such that low pathogenic H6N1 is likely to be the disease agent involved. Similar outbreaks of low pathogenic H6N1 avian influenza have been identified in Northern Ireland, Scotland and England over recent weeks, '' the spokesperson said. `` While the situation in Monaghan is related to a non-notifiable strain of avian influenza, it is a timely reminder of the importance of ensuring high standards of biosecurity in poultry flocks. The Department urges all poultry owners including backyard flock owners to be vigilant and to implement strict biosecurity on their premises, particularly by ensuring only essential personnel, vehicles and equipment have access to their flocks and minimising contact between poultry and wild birds. 
`` Flock-owners should also regularly monitor their birds for signs of disease. If they suspect avian influenza, they must report it immediately to their veterinarian or to one of the Department's Regional Veterinary Offices. '' There have also been a number of outbreaks of the notifiable H5N8 strain of avian influenza in Central Europe and the number of outbreaks has been steadily increasing in the last few weeks, with outbreaks now reported in seven countries.","Northern Ireland, Centeral Europe",https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/bird-flu-reported-at-monaghan-farm-three-others-under-investigation-987242.html,1583931499,2020-03-11 11:58:19+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.irishexaminer.com
15LAC7KSLJ,"Bird flu ‘unlikely’ among pet avians; Maharashtra prepares for outbreak, if any","THANE: Recent as yet unexplained bird deaths in Mumbai Metropolitan Region have pet owners worried. Experts, though, say chances of bird flu among pet avians are low. Meanwhile, the state animal husbandry department said on Saturday there has been no bird flu death in Maharashtra so far, but it has started preparations to tackle any possible outbreak. Crucial autopsy reports from National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal were still awaited, said officials. Veterinarians admitted to getting anxious calls from pet owners and assuaged their fears saying infection among pet birds is unlikely and have advised them to simply follow precautions. Pet owner Mandira Sawant of Kurla said, “I used to keep my two love birds near the window to bask in early morning sun but now have started to avoid it. Oddly, nowadays, they themselves refrain from being kept there and start calling out as if to move them,” said “As of now, I have kept our African grey parrot, a conure and a cockatiel in a bedroom and away from the window. I also regularly spray a disinfectant at home, even when someone comes from outside,” said Saket Ghag of Borivli. Prominent symptoms in infected birds include coughing, sneezing and diarrhoea, said experts. “Waterfowl birds are carriers of the infection, which gets transmitted to other birds when they migrate as they shed droplets and faecal matter in the air. So, birds that come in contact with these can get infected,” said Dr Rina Dev, an avian and exotic birds specialist. “As pet birds are indoors, they are safe as of now. Also, at this moment, one should refrain from buying pet birds,” added Dr Dev. State officials reserved commenting further on the bird flu issue till NIHSAD reports are released. “Our team of doctors is trained to handle carcasses of birds, conduct autopsy and mass culling if any outbreak is reported here. There is no confirmed bird flu death in the state yet but we are taking all precautions to ensure our staff is equipped to handle any emergency situation,” said a senior bureaucrat.

1661MF7MAA,Turkey farmers reflect on virus that hit flocks 5 years ago,"Turkey farmers reflect on virus that hit flocks 5 years ago 
NEWELL, Iowa ( AP ) -- Five years ago, a deadly virus devastated Dale Christiansen's turkey farm in rural Buena Vista County. 
In the spring of 2015, a new strain of avian influenza struck the Midwest, hitting scores of poultry farms in Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota, Minnesota and elsewhere. In Iowa alone, some 31.5 million turkeys and chickens at 77 farms were lost because of the epidemic. The outbreak sent egg prices soaring, though oddly enough there was no shortage of turkeys that Thanksgiving. 

To this day, Christiansen is n't exactly sure how exactly the bird flu reached his flock. He still sometimes searches the internet for USDA reports on it. Experts said the influenza strain was probably spread by the droppings of migratory fowl, such as geese. 
Whatever the cause, he's well acquainted with the consequences of that year's avian influenza, which impacted roughly a quarter of Iowa's turkey farms. 
`` I was the number one site in the whole state that got bird flu in 2015, '' said Christiansen, whose turkey population numbers about 27,000. 
`` The USDA came in, and they euthanized everything, '' he told the Sioux City Journal. 
Re-emerging from that disruptive outbreak was a long, stressful process, but eventually he had his flock back. 
In Sac County that year, Kelli Berg and her husband, Josh, had just purchased a turkey finisher barn, their first foray into turkey husbandry -- a day before they learned that a bird flu epidemic was ravaging poultry farms. Their neighbors to the north and south were soon dealing with outbreaks. 
`` As brand new producers, we did n't know what to expect, and we were scared out of our minds, '' Kelli Berg said. `` But, it ended up not hitting our facility, so we lucked out there. We did n't have any bird flu on our facility. '' 
The 2015 outbreak proved to be a learning experience for the poultry industry. Producers have since implemented intensive bio-security measures to keep pathogens away from their birds. 
`` Like, disinfecting right when you go into the office, which is before you go into your barn. So it's, really making sure you 're disinfected, all of the vehicles on the farm, or that come on the farm, are disinfected, and then disinfecting your buildings after every turn, '' Berg said. `` Any feed truck, any service truck, anything that would come on, they have to disinfect before they even drive on the property. '' 
Gretta Irwin, executive director of the Iowa Turkey Federation, said that the new bio-security protocols were the deciding factor in curtailing the epidemic that year. Infected flocks were culled; farmers were told not to wear uncleaned outside shoes inside their turkey barns, thus keeping soil-borne pathogens at bay; and access to farms dealing with outbreaks was restricted. 
In the end, despite all the hardships, it was a success story of agricultural disease management -- the last known outbreak in Iowa was reported in early June 2015, less than two months after the outbreaks began. Iowa's turkeys were repopulated, and reportedly none of the state's turkey farmers went out of business as a result of the bird flu. The new security protocols, meanwhile, leave Iowa's turkey farms in a better position to weather any future outbreaks. 
`` There's definitely a heightened awareness amongst the farmers, of what they need to be doing to protect the health of the birds, '' Irwin said. 
The 2015 avian influenza was solely a bird problem, as it was not known to have infected any humans. It was obvious from the outset early this year, Christiansen said, that COVID-19 would not be a problem for birds, and indeed it was not. 
He still keeps an eye out for any new bird ailment on the radar, as does Berg. The Iowa Turkey Federation and the Iowa Department of Agriculture do the same. 
`` We still continue today to have meetings to discuss how we plan and prepare for another disease outbreak so that we can quickly address it, '' Irwin said. 
The events of this year had echoes of 2015 for Berg's turkey farm. They just built a new, state-of-the-art brooder site -- baby turkeys live here from shortly after they 've hatched until they reach five weeks. Now a new virus has come to the farm, this time impacting the people and leaving the turkeys unscathed. 
`` A lot of our help has become positive within the last week, '' Berg said on Nov. 18. 
`` We 're making it through, we 're finding folks to help us, '' she added.",South Dakota,https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/Turkey-farmers-reflect-on-virus-that-hit-flocks-5-15762978.php,1607148461,2020-12-05 05:07:41+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.timesunion.com

1896ESE2WR,Bird flu: One dead migratory bird's sample tests positive in Ropar,"PATIALA: The sample of a migratory bird that was found dead in Siswan rivulet in Ropar district of Punjab around ten days back has reported positive on Tuesday according to the wildlife officials. The sample of bar-headed goose, a migratory bird, was taken on January 8 after the wildlife officials found it dead in the Siswan rivulet following which the district officials claimed to have sent the sample for testing. The officials said that it is suspected the bird might have flown from Pong dam and died on the way to his destiny. They said that the bar-headed goose was found dead on the rivulet and there was no residence or poultry farm or bird activity in around one-kilometre area of the location of bird’s death. “We collected the sample of dead bar-headed goose and had immediately sent it for testing in a laboratory in Jalandhar on January 8. After this, we had again sent the sample to laboratory in Bhopal for confirmation of flu and on Tuesday (January 19) we got confirmed reports that dead bird was avian flu positive. But there is no need to worry as no death or no symptoms in birds in one km radius of the dead bird location was found. Also, there is no poultry farm or residence near this location. This migratory bird seemed to have fallen while flying over the rivulet. Since January 8 we are sending around 10 samples daily for testing including from the area where the dead migratory was found”, said Monica Yadav, Ropar District Forest Officer Wildlife. She added that around 15 trap cameras have been installed from last six months over the wildlife area to keep a track of migratory birds and animals while the surveillance activity was increased from last three months. Chief Wildlife Warder Punjab, RK Mishra said, “Only one case has been confirmed positive with the flu and the migratory bird sample was confirmed from Bhopal based laboratory today.

Eighty-six patients were randomly assigned to receive 2 weeks of the triple-drug combination every 12 hours plus as many as three doses of injectable interferon beta-1b every other day, while 41 received lopinavir-ritonavir alone every 12 hours.The researchers detected no live virus on nose-throat swabs within, on average, 7 days of starting the triple-drug combination, 5 days faster than with lopinavir-ritonavir alone (hazard ratio, 4.37; 95% confidence interval, 1.86 to 10.24; P = 0.0010). The combination treatment also halved the mean time to complete symptom relief (4 versus 8 days) and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score of 0 (3 versus 8 days) and shortened the mean hospital stay from 14.5 to 9 days.While patients who received the combination therapy within 7 days of symptom onset did better than those in the control group, there was no difference in outcomes when they were treated 7 or more days after symptoms began. The authors said that the results suggest that the triple combination may minimize the risk of antiviral resistance and decrease risks to healthcare workers by reducing the duration and quantity of viral shedding.""Despite these encouraging findings, we must confirm in larger phase 3 trials that interferon beta-1b alone or in combination with other drugs is effective in patients with more severe illness (in whom the virus has had more time to replicate),"" said lead author Kwok-Yung Yuen, MD, from the University of Hong Kong, in a Lancet news release.

Forty-three of the patients had mild cases of COVID-19, while 6 had severe cases. Researchers obtained specimens every 3 days for 4 weeks.The authors found persistent shedding of virus RNA in both nasopharyngeal swab and feces samples.""The estimated time until loss of virus RNA detection ranged from 45.6 days for nasopharyngeal swab samples to 46.3 days for feces samples in mild cases and from 48.9 days for nasopharyngeal swab samples to 49.4 days for feces samples in severe cases, which was longer than those of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV,"" the authors wrote, referring to the coronaviruses that cause SARS and MERS, respectively.The findings are consistent with published case reports, the authors concluded.

Facilities for first border inspection ( FBI ) in the five major international ports of the Philippines will be put up this year by the Bureau of Animal Industry ( BAI ) to bolster the inspection on infected meat imports and provide critical laboratory test kits and disinfectants. 
Agriculture Secretary William Dar has committed to construct the FBI customs facilities in five of the country's international ports in response to private sector recommendations. 
The Philippine Chamber of Agriculture and Fisheries Inc. ( PCAFI ) and United Broilers Association ( UBRA ) have complained on the entry to the Philippines of the African swine flu ( ASF ) and avian flu due to infected and poorly inspected meat imports. 
PCAFI and UBRA said misdeclared meat importation also deprives the government of huge tax revenues. 
In order to further boost animal production -- cattle, carabao -- without needing to import animals, the DA will distribute semen straws under the Unified National Artificial Insemination Program, Dar said in a letter to PCAFI President Danilo Fausto. 
The DA and the National Meat Inspection Service ( NMIS ) also plan to invest in biosecurity measures to help maintain poultry and livestock products ' quality over a longer period. 
BAI and NMIS are agencies under the DA. 
`` Investment in biosecurity is a necessity and may be part of the new normal, '' said Dar in the letter. 
Dar also said DA is also linking farmers and farm producers with buyers including big manufacturers that need farm raw material inputs. Linkages are being formed with local government units ( LGUs ). 
`` The ( Agriculture ) secretary has always been vocal encouraging our meat processors to source raw meat from local producers especially in this time of coronavirus crisis where imports are restricted. He also asked LGUs to consider buying chicken and eggs directly to the poultry raisers and include these in food subsidy packs for distribution, '' PCAFI and UBRA said in the statement. 
The DA has also asked Cebu to lift its ban on the transport of hogs and pork products to allow more trading of farmers ' products. Southern Leyte has already lifted a similar ban on the transport of pork and related products from General Santos City and South Cotabato. 
Transport of pork and meat products from the Visayas and Mindanao to bigger markets in Luzon is also under way to help stabilize supply and prices in Metro Manila.

1D61GYJMG3,New tool being developed to better forecast bird flu,"New tool being developed to better forecast bird flu 
A tool that can better understand and forecast how the bird flu virus evolves and the risk associated with new strains is being developed. The tool will be the first to predict factors that are currently difficult to forecast, such as whether new virus strains will cause serious harm. Outputs could benefit vaccine development and control strategies to prevent future outbreaks. Bird flu can cause massive economic losses in global food production, as it infects pigs as well as poultry. The virus can also be fatal in humans. Producing vaccines is difficult because of the variety and changeability of flu strains. The prediction tool will combine three computer models and will use more than one million data entries of the virus ' genetic makeup, derived from global surveillance programmes.

Namakkal: The spread of coronavirus and outbreak of bird flu in Kerala have impacted chicken production in poultry farms in the district. Poultry farmers have decided to reduce the chicken production due to crash in prices. `` The price of 1kg of chicken has come down to Rs 27 from Rs 72, '' executive member of National Egg Coordination Committee ` Vangili ' Subramaniam said. He said the impact has been felt in retail markets as well with 1kg of chicken being sold for Rs 60. Worse, fake messages doing rounds on social media that coronavirus spreads through chicken and eggs have also compounded poultry farmers ' problems. `` When the poultry industry has been grappling with problems arising out of coronavirus, the bird flu outbreak worsened the situation further, '' Subramaniam said. People are showing reluctance to eat chicken for these two reasons. Following this, the committee has decided to reduce the chicken production in the district, he said. `` We will take a concrete decision on this after convening a meeting with other poultry farmers, '' he added. Namakkal district is the major hub for chicken and egg production in the state. The district produces 4 crore eggs and 20 lakh chickens daily for sales. `` Of them, 40 lakh eggs and 10 lakh chickens will be sent to Kerala daily, '' Dr P V Senthil, secretary of Livestock and Agri Farmers Trade Association ( LIFT ) said. The district has nearly 988 poultry farms and all the major farms were following bio-security system. `` Though there is no avian flu outbreak in Tamil Nadu, poultry farmers across the district have taken precautionary measures, '' Senthil said, adding that they have ensured chicks are vaccinated without fail. `` In the wake of the bird flu outbreak in Kerala, we have tightened biosecurity in all farms, '' he said.",#,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/salem/sales-down-poultry-farmers-to-cut-down-on-production/articleshow/74619874.cms,1584141180,2020-03-13 22:13:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,timesofindia.indiatimes.com

1HCA65JW52,Bird flu virus heat labile gets killed at cooking temperature,"Image Source : INDIA TV Bird flu virus is heat-labile, gets killed at 'cooking temperature' 

Contrary to what some people think that the bird flu virus, also known as Avian influenza, is spread to humans via consumption of cooked poultry products, health experts on Sunday stressed that it usually does not infect people as the virus is heat-labile (degraded and killed when subjected to heat).
Avian influenza refers to the disease caused by infection with avian (bird) influenza (flu) Type A viruses. These viruses occur naturally among wild aquatic birds worldwide and can infect domestic poultry and other bird and animal species.
According to the World Health organisation (WHO), cooking of poultry (e.g. chicken, ducks and geese) at or above 70 degree Celsius so that absolutely no meat remains raw and red, is a safe measure to kill the virus in areas with outbreaks in poultry.
Richa Sareen, consultant (pulmonology) at Fortis Vasant Kunj in New Delhi, said the virus is heat-labile and it gets killed with cooking temperatures.
""At this time, people should eat fully cooked chicken and eggs and not raw or partially cooked ones. One should avoid going to open markets that sell poultry as they are the focal point of the spread,"" Sareen told IANS.
""People who handle poultry should take special precautions. They should wear PPE, gloves and masks while handling birds and should practice frequent hand washing,"" she added.
Although the virus causing bird flu usually does not infect people, but rare cases of human infection with these viruses have been reported, especially in individuals working with infected domestic birds.
""The possible cause of infections in humans is when they come in contact with birds with the viruses and enough viruses get into a person's eyes, nose or mouth, or is inhaled through the excretions of birds,"" said Kunal Kothari, Senior Physician, Internal Medicine, SMS Medical College in Jaipur.
""The spread of Bird Flu from one individual, who is sick to another has been very rare and data is limited, inefficient and not sustained but as a precaution, we should all be watchful of public health advisory,"" Kothari added.

Bird Flu is a communicable virus among the avian population and human to human spread is not too prominent with the current strain.
However, viruses are prone to mutation, so if this virus undergoes mutation in future, it has the potential to spread from human to human and cause a pandemic.
Bird flu mostly infects the respiratory system of humans. Common symptoms are fever, runny nose, sore throat, cough, muscle aches, etc.
""If severe, it can cause ARDS, multi-organ involvement and even death. The sporadic data on bird flu from the past shows very high mortality, to the tune of 60 per cent. Thus, it becomes important to take precautions now,"" Sareen mentioned.
Nevertheless, maintaining distance from birds in the environment is important as the spread of the avian virus is through the saliva, faecal matter of an infected bird.
""The avian virus is airborne. Notify the community health department on seeing sick or dead birds and try not to come in direct contact with these birds without proper masks, gloves and disinfectants,"" Kothari noted.
The Central government has issued a status report of avian influenza in the country, saying the disease has been confirmed in seven states.
The Ministry of Fisheries, Animal Husbandry & Dairying (DAHD) has issued an advisory to the affected states so as to avoid further spread of disease.

1HXY3470XV,Asian waterbird census from next week amid bird flu fears,"Ranchi: The Asian Waterbird Census (AWC) will kick off in Jharkhand on January 15 amid a bird flu scare. The exercise will be carried out by AWC volunteers and Indian Bird Conservation Network (IBCN) across 10 different wetlands in the state for a headcount of migratory and indigenous birds. During the exercise, surveyors will also report suspected bird flu deaths to the government, officials said. AWC state coordinator Satya Prakash said, “We are working out plans to begin our annual rollout of the census from January 15 now. Usually, it is done between December and January, but this year, it was delayed due to the pandemic.” He added that the survey will be done on parameters prescribed by AWC, an international global waterbird monitoring programme of the International Waterbird Census (IWC) which is coordinated by Wetlands International. In India, AWC was initiated in 1987 with an objective to study birds that mostly migrate from one place to the other during winters. The movement provides key indicators to study the changing environmental scenario. Prakash added that they are currently fine-tuning logistics and volunteers for the exercise. “We will head to about 10 waterbodies like Topchanchi in Dhanbad, Massanjore in Dumka, Udhwa bird sanctuary and other prominent waterbodies that are known as abodes of migratory birds,” he said, adding that besides the ongoing pandemic, the bird flu outbreak in the country may have affected the usual migratory habits of a few species of birds. In 2016-17, the survey was held for the first time in coordination with the state forest department. As many as 71,833 birds were observed, of which 42,223 were migratory. In terms of species, there were a total of 71 of which nine were endangered, 21 resident migrants, 25 migratory and so on. Another round of census two years later witnessed decline in the population to 51,669 birds, of which 26,072 were migratory. It included a total of 73 species comprising 12 threatened, 21 resident migrants, 24 migratory etc. Chief wildlife warden Rajiv Ranjan said, “This time, we couldn’t plan for the census due to various reasons, but we shall plan it regularly from the next fiscal year.”",#,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/ranchi/asian-waterbird-census-from-next-week-amid-bird-flu-fears/articleshow/80191789.cms,1610235000,2021-01-09 22:30:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,timesofindia.indiatimes.com
1KGQEGDLZX,Hundreds of Novel Viruses Discovered in Insects,"Hundreds of Novel Viruses Discovered in Insects 
New viruses that cause disease often come from animals. Well-known examples of this are the Zika virus transmitted by mosquitoes, bird flu viruses, as well as MERS virus, which is associated with camels. In order to identify new viral diseases quickly and prevent possible epidemics, scientists at Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin are targeting their search to viruses in animals. In a current study, they have now discovered hundreds of novel viruses in insects. The results have been published in PLOS Pathogens. 
`` Every new virus we find could be a cause of illnesses that was previously unknown, both in humans and in livestock, '' said Christian Drosten, Director of the Institute of Virology at Charité Mitte. The scientist is a specialist for virus discovery and diagnostics at the German Center for Infection Research ( DZIF ). For example, his team has defined the international standard approach for diagnosing MERS. He is currently focusing on rare virus diagnoses using new sequencing techniques. `` The more viruses we identify and add to our database, the easier it is for us to recognize the cause of new and unusual illnesses, '' says Drosten. 
In the current study, the research team has made use of the largest international transcriptome database on insects and investigated the data it contains with regard to virus genomes. While scientists have previously concentrated on mosquitos and other blood-feeding insects, this study includes all groups of insects. Viruses with negative-strand RNA genomes have been systematically investigated. This group of RNA viruses includes important pathogenic viruses; these cause Ebola and measles, as well as rabies and lung infections. 
In a total of 1.243 insect species, the researchers discovered viruses that can be classified in at least 20 new genera. 
`` This is probably the largest sample of animals ever screened for new viruses, '' said Drosten. 
The working group has already added the new insect viruses to its search databases. With the help of these data, it will now be possible to investigate cases of rare and unusual illnesses in humans. This includes patients who display all the symptoms of a viral infection, however no virus can be identified in the case in question. 
`` In such cases, we use high-throughput sequencing methods to search for all the viruses present in the patient, '' explained Drosten. `` If the patient has a virus, we will find it, provided it is in our database or has similarities with a virus in our database. '' The chances of the search being successful will increase thanks to the addition of the new insect viruses. 
As part of the DZIF project `` Virus detection and preparedness, '' the scientists at Charité will continue to focus on anticipating and detecting future viral threats.

HANOI, Feb. 11 ( Xinhua ) -- Vietnam has reported an outbreak of A/H5N6 bird flu in suburban Hanoi, Vietnam News Agency reported on Tuesday. 
The outbreak was spotted in Phu Nghia commune of Hanoi's suburban Chuong My district, when local authorities found that the flock of fowls were infected with the A/H5N6 strain of bird flu, the news agency quoted Hanoi's Department of Livestock and Animal Health as reporting. 
Local authorities later destroyed a total of 6,807 infected ducks as well as sterilized poultry cages and the surrounding environment in the virus-hit areas.

1LE5KFTHBB,"Novacyt develops new tests for COVID-19, bird flu, launches pandemic mink strain test","Parisian diagnostics company Novacyt is working on a series of new tests for COVID-19 and bird flu.
The French firm has launched a research-use-only (RUO) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for a new strain of COVID-19 and the development of two new RUO PCR tests for avian influenza (aka bird flu) following recent outbreaks across Europe.
On the pandemic front, that new launch is for a specific new mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, and is known as Y453F. Originally found in mink in Denmark and the Netherlands, the Y453F mutation quickly spread to humans and has also been detected outside of Europe.

Some countries have culled tens of thousands of mink to try to stop the spread of this new mutation, but Novacyt says that, despite the virus constantly evolving, as most viruses do, this particular mutation was “of potential concern to scientists and clinicians as it causes an amino acid change which affects antibody binding.”
The company added: “While it is unknown what, if any, impact the amino acid modification will have on vaccines, Novacyt believes a RUO test could help scientists and clinicians to identify patients that carry the virus with the Y453F mutation. Should a clinical need arise for the diagnostic differentiation of Y453F from other strains of COVID-19 infection, Novacyt is well positioned to offer this as a clinical use diagnostic product. The RUO product is immediately available to order.”
As well as COVID-19, the firm is also working on two new RUO PCR tests for avian influenza amid recent outbreaks in Europe.
While no human infection due to these viruses has so far been detected, and the threat to the general population is currently low, continued surveillance of avian influenza viruses in Europe is important to monitor virus evolution and emergence, the company said.
“As a result, Novacyt has developed two RUO PCR tests to assist in the current outbreaks. These include a test to detect all HPAI A(H5) subtypes and a test designed to confirm the specific presence of the HPAI A(H5N8) subtype, which has been at the centre of the current outbreaks.”

1NG8LYOKHM,UK urged to cut meat intake to avoid future pandemic,"UK urged to cut meat intake to avoid future pandemic 
London: The UK needs to drastically cut back its meat intake to avoid a future global health crisis, a group of doctors have warned. 
Plant Based Health Professionals ( PBHP ) said that the connection between major disease outbreaks and factory farming is being `` swept under the carpet '' amid the coronavirus pandemic, as they join a wave of experts urging people to go vegan, the Metro newspaper reported. 
The vast majority of new infectious diseases that have appeared in humans over the past century have been caused by tampering with farmed animals and their habitats, including Swine Flu ( pigs ), Avian Flu ( birds ) and Spanish Flu ( poultry ). 
Speaking to the Metro newspaper, PBHP founder and Consultant Haematologist at King's College Hospital, Shireen Kassam, said that another disease outbreak was `` inevitable if we do not move towards a plant-based diet ''. 
In the UK, demand for cheap meat has fuelled a huge expansion of factory farming -- a controversial process that often sees thousands of animals being packed into small, unsanitary cages. 
This `` provides the perfect conditions for the generation of novel infections with epidemic and pandemic potential '' as well as necessitating the widespread use of antibiotics in animals, `` contributing to a crisis in antibiotic resistance among humans '', Kassam said. 
'' The last 100 years has shown that pandemics will continue unless we change the way we eat and how our food is produced. 
`` Disease is spread predominantly through confinement, we do n't have the land capacity to feed the 8 billion people on this planet free range. 
`` We are in this race to find an antiviral, but other than HIV, there are very few viruses where there are very effective drugs available. ( A vaccine ) is n't just going to save our problems, there is a risk of a mutation that could come back in a few years. 
`` We need to learn from our mistakes. We need to change our land use to grow beans and legumes, we need a system change, '' she told the newspaper. 
Poor diets are the main cause of chronic health conditions in adults in the UK, while pre-existing health conditions such as obesity and diabetes are seen as risk factors in catching COVID-19, which has infected 252,246 peopled and killed 36,124 in the country so far. 
Research from the University of Oxford last year found foods with the largest negative environmental impacts such as unprocessed and processed red meat, were linked with the largest increases in disease risk, while foods associated with improved health ( whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts and some vegetable oils high in unsaturated fats, such as olive oil ) have among the lowest environmental impacts.",#,https://english.manoramaonline.com/lifestyle/health/2020/05/22/uk-urged-to-cut-meat-intake-avoid-future-pandemic.html,1590142050,2020-05-22 08:07:30+00:00,075a4e9c14,english.manoramaonline.com

1PCINTU3Y3,China's Ticking Time Bomb of Infectious Disease,"China's Ticking Time Bomb of Infectious Disease 
A highly pathogenic strain of bird flu, H5N1, has caused an outbreak in China's Hunan province, near ground zero of the deadly coronavirus. 
The disease does n't easily infect humans but when it does, it carries a staggering mortality rate of 60 % according to the WHO. 
China is a hotbed of emerging diseases. As the country rises to economic prominence, this puts the global economy at risk. 

For most people who live in first world countries, infectious diseases are not a big concern. We get a cocktail of vaccines as children and go on to live relatively healthy lives. The biggest things we have to worry about are the common flu, the common cold, and occasionally, strep throat. As China rises to global prominence, in a world that has grown increasingly interconnected, things may be changing. 
We could be reverting to a time when deadly diseases were a fact of life for everyone -- in every country. 
As the global coronavirus outbreak grows to infect over 20,000 with 425 fatalities, China finds itself in the cross hairs of a new, dangerous outbreak: bird flu, an infection that can kill poultry and humans alike. While the disease, known as H5N1, has n't infected any humans yet, it's revealing a disturbing pattern with global implications. New diseases are emerging at an alarming rate, and this puts the whole world at risk. 
The Coronavirus is Still at Large 
According to the latest data, Wuhan coronavirus has grown to infect 20,680 people -- the majority in Hubei province, China. The disease has spread to 27 countries and 427 people have died. 
In response, U.S authorities have taken drastic actions to limit contact with China. The State Department has issued a travel warning, airlines are canceling flights and American companies with Chinese operations are shuttering operations in the country. 
Source: twitter.com 
Authorities should have the ability to get the coronavirus under control but what will they do when the next massive outbreak crops up? Can the global economy withstand these repeated shocks? 
Another Outbreak: Bird Flu 

According to China's Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs, the nation is experiencing an outbreak of a highly pathogenic strain of bird flu called H5N1. The disease has already killed 4,500 chickens in Hunan province alone and the government has culled almost 18,000 chickens to prevent its spread. 
According to the United States Geological Survey, there's no need to panic about the term `` highly pathogenic '' because it refers to the virus's ability to kill chickens, not humans. 
They state the following: 
The designation of low or highly pathogenic avian influenza refers to the potential for these viruses to kill chickens. The designation of `` low pathogenic '' or `` highly pathogenic '' does not refer to how infectious the viruses may be to humans, other mammals, or other species of birds. 
The World Health Organization ( WHO ) paints a more disturbing picture of the disease. 
Human cases of H5N1 avian influenza occur occasionally, but it is difficult to transmit the infection from person to person. When people do become infected, the mortality rate is about 60 %. 
They go on to elaborate 
Influenza viruses constantly undergo genetic changes. It would be a cause for concern, should the H5N1 virus become more easily transmissible among humans. 
A 60 % mortality rate is staggering. To put this in perspective, note that coronavirus has a mortality rate of only 2.1 % while SARS had a mortality rate of 9.6 %. With a mortality rate of 60 %, the bird flu is as deadly as Ebola. While it does n't currently spread well among humans, experts believe it can mutate into more virulent forms. 
This is a ticking time bomb.

1R2M9TYVGI,Public has more trust in Trump administration to contain coronavirus than previous outbreaks: Poll,"Public has more trust in Trump administration to contain coronavirus than previous outbreaks: Poll 
More than three in four respondents have faith in the federal government to contain the coronavirus as the deadly illness continues to spread throughout China and other countries. 
Coronavirus has claimed the lives of more than 2,000 people worldwide, but 77 % of those asked by Gallup in a poll released Thursday believe in the federal government's ability to contain the illness. Just 22 % reported having no confidence in the federal government's ability to protect Americans from the virus. 
Much of the trust likely stems from the minimal impact the illness has had on Americans compared with other countries around the world. Globally, more than 76,000 people have been infected, but only 15 people in the United States have a confirmed case of coronavirus with 52 other potential cases under investigation, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Respondents were more confident in the Trump administration's ability to defend Americans from coronavirus than they were during other outbreaks and administrations. In 2017, 64 % of respondents had faith in the Trump administration's ability to contain the Zika virus. 
Under the Obama administration, just 58 % trusted the federal government to contain Ebola in 2014 while 67 % had faith in the administration's ability to contain swine flu in 2009. In 2005, just 54 % trusted the Bush administration to prevent bird flu from spreading in the U.S.. 
The confidence in the Trump administration's ability to respond to coronavirus has not been reflected in the remarks made by 2020 Democrats about the virus. Elizabeth Warren called Trump's response to the illness `` a mess, '' while Joe Biden called Trump the `` worst possible leader '' to manage coronavirus. 
Although respondents were confident in the federal government's ability to protect Americans from the illness, they also feared the impact it could have on the economy. Nearly two-thirds of respondents claimed they felt coronavirus would negatively affect the economy, including 16 % who feared it would have a `` very negative effect. ''

1RLUZOCAP9,When the Games went viral: Historic Olympic health scares,"When the Games went viral: Historic Olympic health scares 
Tokyo 2020 organizers will this autumn begin the task of devising safety protocols to allow the Games to take place if the coronavirus pandemic is still raging. 
But Tokyo 2020, which had been due to start on Friday until it was postponed for a year, will not be the first Olympic Games to face a health crisis, although the scale of the challenge posed by COVID-19 is unprecedented. 
AFP looks at previous Olympics that went ahead in the face of viral outbreaks. 

Nagano 1998: Flu 
There was an outbreak of influenza the last time Japan hosted the Games -- the Winter Olympics in the central city of Nagano in 1998. 
Nearly 1,500 schoolchildren in the Nagano region came down with the flu and some 200 people connected with the Games were taken ill -- although officials stressed other illnesses were also to blame. 

The virus prevented Norwegian 1,500 meter gold medal-winning speed skater Adne Sondral from going for a double in the 1,000 meters. 
German figure skating medal hopeful Tanja Szewczenko pulled out over health fears and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) also got involved, warning competitors against the flu and advising them to take on plenty of fluids. 
That outbreak of flu was unrelated to the killer bird flu hitting southern China at the time. 

Rio 2016: Zika 
Ahead of the 2016 Rio Olympics, the talk was dominated by Zika, a mosquito-borne virus that can cause pregnant women to give birth to babies with microcephaly -- a deformation that results in abnormally small brains and heads. 
The Zika outbreak began in 2015 and infected around 1.5 million people, according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ), mainly in Brazil. 
There was concern that international visitors to the Games could spread the virus globally, even though the WHO assessed the risk as `` minimal. '' 
Some leading tennis players and golfers -- including golf's current world number one Rory Mc. 
Ilroy -- decided not to compete due to fears over the virus. 
The stories proved more dramatic than the facts, with no new cases reported during the Games. 

Mexico 1968: Flu 
The 1968 Olympics in Mexico took place during one of the worst pandemics of the 20th century -- the Hong Kong Flu. 
It spread throughout Asia after emerging in the then British colony neighboring southern China, and had reached the Americas by late 1968, eventually killing around one million people but had little impact on the Games. 

Antwerp 1920: Flu 
Held in the aftermath of the Spanish Flu, considered to be the most deadly in history and claiming up to 50 million lives, the Antwerp Games were seen as a symbol of humanity's effort to rebuild after the devastation of World War I. 
Although the Spanish Flu killed five times more people than died in 1914 - 18 war, the impact of the virus was overshadowed by the global conflict. 
A century on, Tokyo 2020 organizers have been at pains to stress that if the Games go ahead they will again stand as a beacon of triumph against adversity.","southern China, southern China ",https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2020/07/22/when-the-games-went-viral-historic-olympic-health-scares.html,1595402100,2020-07-22 05:15:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.thejakartapost.com
1S9X6ZAQ8Y,Rapid response teams set up to keep a tab on bird flu,"Not a single case in district or state; officials say no harm in eating chicken as of now
In wake of bird flu cases being reported from six states, the Pune district deputy collector of animal husbandry has formed rapid response teams to look for any signs of suspicious deaths in wild or poultry birds.

Although flu cases have been reported mostly among migratory wild birds in six states, rumours and panic among citizens may hit farmers and retailers in poultry business, which has already been struggling for months.

Officials claim not a single suspected case of bird flu is reported in Pune district.

The district alone has a poultry population of 1.83 crore - the highest in the state. The animal husbandry has formed 13 rapid response teams which will close work with panchayats, forest department and veterinary hospitals. The officials have now started strict implementation of the Prevention and Control of Infectious and Contagious Diseases in Animals Act, 2009. They have also written to all panchayats to inform suspicious bird flu deaths to the team immediately.

Dr Sheetalkumar Mukane, district deputy collector of animal husbandry, said, bird flu cases spread due to the migratory birds that come to India during the winter months. “There has been no single case of bird flu reported in the state as of yet, let alone the district. We have formed the rapid response teams to keep a check for any suspicious deaths reported in birds if any. Throughout the year, our veterinarians visit these poultry farms to check for quality control. People should not panic and it is safe to consume chicken,” said Mukane.

According to officials on Friday, the central government confirmed bird flu cases in six states - Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana and Gujarat. After this, Maharashtra has been on high alert as H5N1virus outbreak was reported in Nandurbar and Dhule districts in 2006. On Friday, as many as 900 hens have died at a poultry farm in Murumba village in Parbhani district run by a self-help group. Their samples have been sent for investigation to identify the exact cause of the death.

Dr Mukane added that there are over 325 veterinary hospitals in Pune district and the response teams are also in touch with these. “Any unusual death has to be reported to nearest veterinary hospital. The samples of the birds will be sent to the veterinary hospital in Aundh for disease testing. In case of further suspicion, the samples will be sent to Bhopal. The teams will visit the waterbodies, big farmers and poultries in the district,” added Dr Mukane.

Dr Shivaji Vidhate, district animal husbandry officer, Zilla Parishad, said the training of 65 members of the rapid response team has been completed. A war room has been formed at the district level for bird flu prevention and surveillance. “The teams have been asked to give report about deaths of both wild and domestic birds twice at 11 am and 4 pm. In case of rise in death of birds or suspicious deaths, the rapid response team will reach the spot immediately and take the samples and sent it to the laboratory for analysis,” said Dr Vidhate.

Dr Vidhate added that till the reports from lab come, the 10 km area where the birds died will be turned into an alert zone. “Unfortunately, if the samples come positive for bird flu, the entire 1-km area will be sealed and surveillance will be done in the radius of 10 km,” he added.",#,https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/pune/civic/rapid-response-teams-set-up-to-keep-a-tab-on-bird-flu/articleshow/80191243.cms,1610238600,2021-01-09 23:30:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,punemirror.indiatimes.com

Bird flu has been detected in a goose found in Rogaland. The Veterinary Institute has analyzed samples from the bird, which show highly pathogenic bird flu A (H5N8).

This virus has caused outbreaks among birds in several European countries this autumn. The virus can cause serious illness in birds, but has not been detected in humans. The Norwegian Food Safety Authority is following up the incident.
During this autumn, several outbreaks of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N8) have been seen in wild birds and poultry in Europe. The infection has also been detected in wild birds and poultry in Denmark and on a turkey farm in Scania in Sweden earlier in November. On 27 November, the Veterinary Institute announced the discovery of the virus in a dead wild goose found in Rogaland. This is the first time that highly pathogenic bird flu has been detected in Norway.
Avian influenza A (H5N8) is highly pathogenic (highly pathogenic) to birds, but is not associated with human disease. The consequences of any infection from wild birds to poultry can be serious for the poultry industry.

A similar virus has caused major outbreaks in birds in Europe also in previous years, without cases of infection from birds to humans being detected, says doctor Trine Hessevik Paulsen. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health considers the risk of infection to humans to be very low.
The veterinary authorities are responsible for following up and handling the incident.
We closely monitor the situation and cooperate with the Norwegian Food Safety Authority and the Veterinary Institute. The National Institute of Public Health assists, among other things, with advice on infection control for humans, says Paulsen.
The Norwegian Food Safety Authority has today issued information on how to prevent infection from wild birds to domestic birds. In addition, the veterinary authorities encourage the public to notify the Norwegian Food Safety Authority of the discovery of weakened and dead birds.
For general infection control reasons, one should always avoid touching sick and dead birds, says Paulsen.",#,http://outbreaknewstoday.com/norway-h5n8-avian-influenza-detected-in-wild-goose-35762/,1606530597,2020-11-28 01:29:57+00:00,075a4e9c14,outbreaknewstoday.com
1ZJSYO35L8,WBVR research provides insight into course of bird flu infections,"The threat of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) outbreaks in poultry remains high, with several poultry farms becoming infected in recent years. In order to gain more insight into the course and transmission of HPAI infections, Wageningen Bioveterinary Research (WBVR) has examined the disease symptoms, virus shedding, and mortality following infection with recent H5 viruses.The research shows that an infection with the HPAI H5N8-2014, H5N8-2016, or H5N6-2017 virus differs considerably between chickens, ducks and Eurasian wigeons. The pathogenicity of the viruses for chickens is higher than that for ducks and Eurasian wigeons. The results also suggest that the pathogenicity of HPAI H5 viruses and the virus shedding for ducks is evolving, which may have consequences for the risk of introduction of these viruses into the poultry sector.Avian influenza virus easily transmissible via waterThe research also observed higher levels of virus shedding for ducks and wigeons infected with the 2016 and 2017 viruses than for the 2014 virus. Infected wild birds (such as wigeons) can introduce the virus to poultry farms through bird faeces. The more of the virus present in bird faeces, the easier it is to transmit the virus to poultry. This research also shows that the virus can survive for a long time in water (more than a week) and that chickens can easily become infected by drinking water contaminated with bird faeces.WBVR is conducting further research into the genetic factors and other aspects that determine the pathogenicity of HPAI viruses. A better understanding of the characteristics of HPAI viruses can contribute to the prevention of future outbreaks.Read the full article: /Public Release.

 The country has confirmed 66 cases of the malign H5N8 strain of avian influenza since late November, including the latest case from a duck farm in Gimje, about 260 kilometers southwest of Seoul, the previous day, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs.
 Authorities are required to cull all poultry within a 3-kilometer radius of infected farms.
 Gyeonngi Province surrounding the capital city accounted for 17 cases, and North Jeolla Province took up 14 infections.
 Amid growing concerns over virus transmission from migratory birds to poultry, the country has so far confirmed 74 cases of highly pathogenic bird flu from wild bird habitats. Some 20 suspected cases are also under investigation.
 With millions of birds being culled, the local price of eggs and chicken products also rose sharply.

20ZGQE4JJW,NI poultry farmers urged to take action following bird flu cases in Kent and Cheshire,"Northern Ireland poultry farmers have been urged to take action now to reduce the risk of their flocks contracting Avian Influenza.
Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots and Northern Ireland’s chief veterinary officer Dr. Robert Huey made the warning after confirmations of the disease in Kent and Cheshire this week.
Avian Influenza strain H5N8 was confirmed at a commercial holding in Cheshire on Monday (November 2) and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza (LPAI H5N2) at a smallholding in Kent on Tuesday (November 3).
A total of 14,000 birds will have to be culled between the two farms to limit the spread.
Minister Poots said: “Northern Ireland is currently free of Avian Influenza but these current cases being confirmed in Cheshire and Kent are timely reminders that it is a constant threat.
As we are now entering the high-risk period for the disease due to the winter wild bird migrating season, it is vitally important that all keepers of poultry, including game birds and pet birds, take action now to carefully consider and improve biosecurity to reduce the risk of transmission of disease to their flocks.
“If Avian Influenza were to enter any flock, including backyard or hobby flocks, it would have a devastating effect on the poultry industry and would significantly impact international trade.”
Northern Ireland chief veterinary officer Dr. Robert Huey added: “Following the confirmations of Avian Influenza H5N8 in Cheshire and Low Pathogenic Avian Influenza H5N2 in Kent, I would urge all poultry keepers to take action now to keep your birds safe and reduce the risk of disease over the high-risk winter period.
“Please continue to adopt good biosecurity measures on your premises and review business continuity plans. Remain alert for any signs of disease.
Should you suspect disease in your birds please report it immediately to your local DAERA Direct Office on: 0300-200-7840.

21DDG18KXO,Analysts split on industrial real estate’s resilience to COVID-19 crisis,"Analysts split on industrial real estate's resilience to COVID-19 crisis 
Analysts at two of Canada's largest commercial real estate firms are split on how COVID-19 will affect the industrial real estate sector. 

Marcus & Millichap, in its report Coronavirus outbreak: implications for real estate, noted that history has shown that pandemics, while very scary, are fairly brief. 

`` Pandemic outbreaks such as SARS, the H1N1 `` swine flu, '' and the `` avian flu '' or `` bird flu '' short-term market instability that moved toward stabilization over the following three to six months, '' the report stated. 

It continued: `` While the flow of goods from China may taper over the short term due to the shutdown of several Chinese factories, this poses little risk to industrial space demand. Western Canada port markets ' industrial vacancy rates remain exceptionally low and face modest development risk. Some companies may postpone commitments for large space blocks at major warehouse facilities as they cautiously monitor the economic outlook and await additional information on the supply chain outlook. '' 

However, Colliers International, in its recent COVID-19: Implications for Canadian real estate, warned that Canada's industrial sector is expected to be heavily impacted by disruption in international supply chains. 

`` With China being the largest global manufacturer of components, the ripple effect of plant closures in the automotive, electronic and pharmaceutical industries has caused a severe disruption, '' the report stated. 

The situation has resulted in Port of Vancouver reporting an 85 per cent decline in volume of Chinese container shipments with 50 per cent fewer sailings. Logistic companies in Toronto have reported 60 per cent fewer inbound containers, Colliers noted. 

Colliers advised industrial occupiers to assess their risk tolerance to determine inventory levels required to handle a potentially huge increase in shipments once the virus threat ends. 

Occupiers may be required to restructure financials to allow for more liquidity and seek larger spaces to accommodate the extra inventory, Colliers noted. 

Doing so could be challenging, given the historically low industrial vacancy rates in Canada's major markets, with 0.4 per cent vacancy in the Greater Toronto Area and 1.2 per cent in Metro Vancouver. 

`` As supply returns to the market, industrial occupiers should capitalize on the demand opportunities to regain their lost capital, '' Colliers recommended.",Western Canada,http://www.westerninvestor.com/news/british-columbia/analysts-split-on-industrial-real-estate-s-resilience-to-covid-19-crisis-1.24106484,1585239926,2020-03-26 15:25:26+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.westerninvestor.com

` Intensive farming is the perfect breeding ground for future pandemics ` The next pandemic could be sparked by the ` world's addiction to intensive animal farming ', a major new white paper has warned. The paper, The connection between animal agriculture, viral zoonoses, and global pandemics, was penned by global animal protection organization Humane Society International. Thanks for watching! Visit Website'The perfect breeding ground for future pandemics ` It says intensive farming, in which ` thousands of stressed animals are kept in close proximity ' is ` the perfect breeding ground for future pandemics '. In a bid to protect us from further pandemics, ` world leaders must accelerate action to shift global diets towards more plant-based foods ', the paper adds. It notes that farmed animals have ` been at the heart of multiple zoonotic disease outbreaks over the past two centuries ', listing H5N1 avian influenza, Nipah virus, and HINI swine flu among those which have transmitted from animals to humans. ' A petri dish of disease'In a statement sent to Plant Based News, Julie Janovsky, Humane Society International's vice president of farm animal campaigns, said: `` Since news broke that COVID-19 likely originated in a live animal market where stressed animals crowded in cages, in unsanitary conditions, we began examining what other human exploitation of animals could create a similar petri dish of disease. Thanks for watching! Visit Website. 
Thanks for watching! Visit Website `` It's clear looking at the data that the unprecedented increase and expansion of intensive animal agriculture, mostly on factory farms, in which we raise and slaughter more than 80 billion animals around the world every year, is a clear front-runner. `` The message is simple, if we want to stop future pandemics, we have to significantly kick the meat habit, and global leaders need to actively assist in shifting global diets towards more plant-based eating. `` COVID-19 likely originated in a live animal market ( Photo: Adobe. Do not use without permission ) ` Intensive animal farming is a key culprit ` Sara Shields, Humane Society International's farm animal senior scientist, added: `` If we study past outbreaks of animal to human disease, we can see a pattern emerge that clearly identifies intensive animal farming as a key culprit. `` The outbreak of Nipah in Malaysia in 1997 was an example of wild to domestic species virus spillover, and meta-analysis has shown that highly pathogenic avian influenza is enabled by the confinement of thousands of birds together where mutating viruses are easily exchanged between hosts. `` We can make our world less vulnerable to future pandemics, but only by reevaluating animal agriculture and shifting more to plant-based sources of protein. To do this requires governments to actively engage in rebalancing our food system, but as consumers we are also directly responsible for the impacts of our food choices. '' ` Pushing animals to the limits of their endurance'Claire Bass, executive director of Humane Society International UK, said: `` We await Part Two of the government's National Food Strategy in 2021 which will look at the food system, its power dynamics and the harm it does. COVID-19 has shown clearly that we can not keep pushing animals to the limit of their endurance and expect to remain isolated from the effects. `` The Food Strategy must robustly challenge our love affair with cheap meat, and rapidly chart a course towards plant-centric diets as the new norm. `` Consumers have already begun this revolution, the plant-based food market is booming, so whether by swapping out beef burgers with veggie burgers that mimic the taste and texture of meat, or using plant milks in place of dairy milk, it's a critical time to make conscientious diet decisions that will lead to better outcomes for the health of animals, humans and the planet.

CEBU CITY, Philippines -- The Cebu Provincial Veterinary office has assured that Cebu remains free from bird flu despite the reemergence of the viral disease in Jaen town, Nueva Ecija. 
Dr. Mary Rose Vincoy, provincial veterinarian, said they continued to intensify their surveillance and border controls to ensure that the H5N6 Avian Influenza strain could not penetrate the province's poultry industry.

`` During the avian influenza outbreak in 2017, Cebu was spared. With the measures nga atong gi-impose sa border, we are hoping the same, '' Vincoy said in a press briefing at the Capitol. 
Vincoy said they had identified Bantayan Island in northern Cebu as a high risk area for the bird flu considering the poultry industry there. 
`` We already did our surveillance as early as January but karon nangayo ta og reports from other LGUs under Cebu province because we have identified risk areas. Una ani ang Bantayan Island which most of our layer farms ( are ), '' said Vincoy. 
Vincoy called on poultry farm owners to cooperate with them and immediately report if there were unusual mortalities among their livestock.

H5N6 has already killed 3,000 quails in a farm in Jaen, according to a report of Inquirer.net. Another 12,000 quails in the same farm were also culled to contain the spread of the virus. 
The tale of avian influenza, however, is not new to Jaen which was also struck by the H5N6 influenza in 2017. 
H5N6, according to Vincoy, had been considered as a highly transmissive strain of the bird flu virus because it was zoonotic. 
This means that the disease may be transmitted by the birds to humans. / dbs

25E4S3JDUP,Should You Eat Chicken or Eggs Amid Bird Flu? Here’s What WHO Says,"With 10 states, including Kerala, Maharashtra and Himachal Pradesh confirming cases of Avian Influenza or bird flu, the government is on high alert and the surveillance in poultry farms, live bird markets, and zoos have been increased.
Though the flu primarily affects birds, it can infect humans who come in close contact with the sick birds.
What is bird flu?
According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), bird flu is a type of influenza virus (H5N1 virus) which causes severe respiratory diseases in birds and can spread to humans. But it is difficult for this virus to transmit from one person to the next.
With reports of poultry culling owing to the flu, and a major price drop in the price of poultry in some regions, concerns have been raised over the consumption of chicken and eggs at this time.
Is it safe to consume chicken and eggs at this time?
Yes, it is safe to consume poultry meat and eggs. According to the WHO official site, there is no epidemiological data which suggests that the disease can be transmitted to humans through cooked food (even if the bird was contaminated with the virus before cooking).
However, a few cases have been linked to consumption of undercooked contaminated poultry that had traces of blood.
WHO mentions that it is safe to consume cooked poultry and eggs because the virus is heat sensitive and when the food reaches 70-degree celsius in all parts, the pathogens cannot survive.
The website states that a large number of human infections with the H5N1 virus have been linked to slaughter practises undertaken at home that leads to the handling of the dead birds before cooking. It suggests avoiding these practises completely and washing hands with soap and water after handling raw poultry meat.
Dr Raja Selvarajan, a General Physician at Corona Health Care clinic in Bengaluru also says that it is safe to consume poultry and eggs as long as it is thoroughly cooked.
He says, “As a precautionary measure, it is advisable to avoid cooking poultry and eggs in the microwave. Use only stove-top methods to ensure that the food is cooked to at least 100-degree celsius.”

27GLQOBU6R,USDA Lawsuit Says Current Meat Policies Are Pandemic Risks,"USDA Lawsuit Says Current Meat Policies Are Pandemic Risks 
Animal activists are suing the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) over its factory farm policies. 
The Humane Society of the United States ( HSUS ) -- an animal rights organization -- filed the lawsuit earlier this month. It alleges the USDA has failed to properly regulate the factory farming industry. 
This increases the risk of the `` development and spread of highly pathogenic zoonotic diseases, '' like bird flu. 
The animal rights group says the USDA's Animal Plant Health Inspection Service's ( APHIS ) response plan to bird flu is `` shortsighted and dangerous. '' 
VIDEO 
`` Five years ago, seeing the threat of potential disease outbreaks based on farm animal to human transmission, we asked APHIS to consider how its Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza control plan could help prevent the development and spread of bird flu, '' HSUS said in a statement. 
`` The HSUS suggested a plan that would incentivize producers to give animals room to move naturally, instead of the industrialized norm which often involves cramming birds into cages, '' the group added. 
It continued: `` Giving animals more space would reduce the risk of mutation and spread of disease. But APHIS went in another direction. [ Its plan ] essentially subsidizes the extreme confinement of animals that causes the threat in the first place. '' 
The HSUS is suing the USDA over conditions in factory farms. 
Factory Farms And Zoonotic Diseases 
Zoonotic diseases like influenza and the novel coronavirus ( COVID-19 ) can spread easily on factory farms due to overcrowded, unsanitary conditions. 
`` While the COVID-19 pandemic likely resulted from a wildlife market and the wildlife trade, prior deadly and costly outbreaks of pathogenic illness in the global food chain have been linked to farm animals, '' HSUS said. 
It explained: `` For instance, a 2003 bird flu outbreak came from infected chickens. [ T ] he 2009 H1N1 swine flu outbreak that sickened nearly 60 million people was linked to U.S. pig farms. '' 
The lawsuit says `` preventing both the creation and spread of highly infectious and lethal disease is of paramount importance. [ It ] should be a top priority for the federal government. '' 
In order to prevent influenza outbreaks, the HSUS encourages the government to ban the intensive confinement of caged chickens. It says cage-free practices will `` give the birds dramatically more space and ability to engage in healthy, natural behaviors. ``

Up to 40,000 poultry are due to be slaughtered after bird flu was found responsible for the deaths of at least 25,000 turkeys in eastern Poland, according to local media and authorities. 
Thursday's mass slaughter of birds comes in the Lubartow area, an important poultry farming region, Polish veterinary authorities said. 
It was not clear how the bird flu virus found its way to the farms. 
Poland is Europe's largest poultry producer, according to data from Eurostat, and last had an outbreak of bird flu in 2017.

Andrzej Danielak, president of the Polish Association of Breeders and Poultry Producers, said three farms might be affected, with up to 350,000 birds at risk in a three-kilometre ( 1.9-mile ) radius. 
`` Veterinary services are implementing virus eradication procedures in this situation, '' local authorities in Lubartow county said in a press release issued on Tuesday, adding that the virus was a subtype of the highly pathogenic H5N8 bird flu that can also threaten people. 
The H5N8 strain has not yet infected any humans anywhere in the world to date, according to the United Kingdom's National Health Service. 
The authorities said crisis meetings had been held, while footage from private broadcaster Polsat showed police cars blocking a road in the area.

2B79GYIOY9,Bird flu spreads to 10 states; Centre allays fears of transmission to humans,"NEW DELHI: Hundreds of birds were reported dead in different parts of the country on Monday as the raging bird flu spread to 10 states and Union Territories, prompting several control measures and a government assurance that there are no scientific reports of the virus' transmission to humans.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked all state governments to remain alert and ensure a constant vigil near places such as water bodies, zoos and poultry farms.

He expressed hope that through proper coordination between Forest, Health and Animal Husbandry Departments, ""we will be able to overcome this challenge soon"".

Officials also tried to allay fears of those consuming poultry products, saying there is no risk of infection from fully cooked chicken, or boiled and cooked eggs as the virus cannot withstand high temperatures.

Delhi, Uttarakhand and Maharashtra on Monday confirmed bird flu cases, adding to the list of seven states -- Kerala, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh – which had already reported avian deaths due to the disease.

While states announced several measures including mass culling of poultry, ban on live birds markets and restriction on chicken and related food materials, the Centre asked them not to close mandis or impede the sales of poultry products.

Animal Husbandry and Dairying Minister Giriraj Singh said there have been no scientific reports on transmission of bird flu to humans and consumers should not be scared.

The Centre also directed states to maintain adequate stock of PPE kits and accessories required for culling operations.

The Delhi government imposed a ban on the sale of processed and packaged chicken brought from outside the city, as samples of ducks from Sanjay Lake tested positive for bird flu.

""But there is no need to panic about bird flu. It is a common influenza,"" Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia said.

Dr Rakesh Singh from the animal husbandry unit of the Development Department said a drive to cull ducks has begun at Sanjay Lake, where several ducks were found dead in the last few days.

In neigbourin Haryana, culling of infected birds is underway to control the spread of the disease.

A central team was visiting Himachal Pradesh and Panchkula for carrying out monitoring of the epicentre sites and conducting an epidemiological investigation.

The Lucknow Zoo in Uttar Pradesh, meanwhile, suspended its bird exchange programme and closed its aviary for visitors after samples of a couple of bird carcasses in Kanpur Zoo were found positive.

The Kanpur Zoological Park has already been closed for visitors till further orders.

In Shahjahanpur's Kalaan three ducks were found dead on Friday morning, with officials saying sample from other ducks will be sent to Bareilly for testing.

In Ballia, carcasses of five crows were found on Sunday night in Sahatwar police station area. Chief veterinary officer of the district Ashok Mishra said, ""The forest department has taken all the carcasses in its custody and those were being sent to Bhopal for testing.""

In Maharashtra, avian influenza has been confirmed as the cause of death of different birds in Parbhani, Mumbai, Thane, Beed and Dapoli in Maharashtra, as per test reports of a Bhopal-based lab.

Parbhani Collector Deepak Muglikar told PTI that bird flu has been confirmed as the cause of death of around 900 hens at a poultry farm in Murumba village and the district administration has decided to cull nearly 8,000 birds in the village. The culling may begin from Tuesday.

According to the Bhopal-based ICAR-National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD), two crows from Mumbai died due to bird flu.

Three pond egrets and a parrot from Thane were infected by the H5N1 avian influenza virus, the institute's test report said.

Besides, a chicken and two herons from Parbhani too died of H5N1 avian influenza virus, while crows from Beed and Dapoli (in Ratnagiri district) were infected by H5N8 avian influenza virus, as per the report.

Bird flu cases have been confirmed in Gujarat's Surat and Vadodara districts as some samples of dead crows from there have tested positive for the avian influenza.

In Uttarakhand, nearly 200 birds, mostly crows, were found dead in Dehradun and Rishikesh, officials said.

KARIMNAGAR: Chicken shop owners and consumers heaved a sigh of relief as all the tests carried out so far to detect bird flu have come negative. 
After some chickens died in the state, poultry farm owners and suppliers started taking precautionary measures. 
No positive cases
Veterinary and Animal Husbandry Department Deputy Director Bandari Narender told The New Indian Express that no positive cases had been detected in Karimnagar until now.Cloacal swabs and blood samples taken from birds at random were sent to the Veterinary Biological and Research Institute in Hyderabad. There are about 20 lakh poultry birds and 3.5 lakh country birds in the district. 
Poultry associations will conduct a programme to create awareness that there is no threat to human beings from hens and chicken, even if they are eaten, Narender said.Sanitation and hygiene conditions have been improved at poultry farms as part of precautionary measures. 
Demand for mutton spikes
Meanwhile, with people scared that the virus may get transmitted from chicken to human beings, consumption of chicken has almost stopped in Karimangar, with people preferring mutton instead. As a result, for the past two days, mutton price has spiked. 
On Wednesday, the cost of mutton was Rs 800 per kg, while a few days ago it was Rs 600.  An owner of a chicken centre told The New Indian Express that usually they sell about 30 kg chicken per day, but now, they were selling only 3 kg. Similarly, sales of eggs have also come down due to the virus.

Reading Time: 2 minutes. 
Bhubaneswar: The Animal Resources Development ( ARD ) Department sealed the poultry research farm, which had reported cases of bird flu, inside the Veterinary College premises of the Odisha University of Agriculture Technology ( OUAT ) and put up red flags on Tuesday. 
The farm was sealed in the presence of the central team members, Chief District Medical Officer ( CDVO ), Khurda, director, ARD and OUAT officials. 
Later, Khurda CDVO issued the sanitation certificate to the ARD Department. 
Talking to mediapersons, ARD director Ratnakar Rout said that the sanitation certificate about the measure taken so far to prevent an outbreak of bird flu will be sent to the Centre. 
`` We have also written a letter to the OUAT dean to take further steps as per the protocol and guidelines of the Centre, '' he added. 
Stating that the poultry research farm has been sealed for three months, Rout said that a team of the ARD Department will visit the farm in every 15 days to review the situation. `` We have also told the OUAT authorities not to rear any bird inside the research farm for one year. The farm will be sealed for one year, '' he said. 
Notably, the OUAT authorities had confirmed bird flu cases in the poultry research farm on January 27 after the samples of the dead chickens sent to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases in Bhopal were found positive. 
Following the confirmation, the ARD Department had formed 11 Rapid Response Teams ( RRTs ) to cull chickens in one km radius of the farm.

2E3IG2USV3,Bird flu threat returns to haunt poultry farmers in S. Korea,"Bird flu threat returns to haunt poultry farmers in S. Korea 
A chicken farm in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province, undergoes disinfection last month after highly pathogenic avian influenza was discovered from a migrant bird habitat in the city. ( Yongin Metropolitan Government ) 
SEOUL -- South Korean authorities and farmers are on alert after a highly pathogenic avian influenza was detected in wild bird droppings for the first time in 32 months. 
The first case was reported on Oct. 25 in Cheonan, South Chungcheong Province, and was soon followed by another discovery of the contagious H5N8 strain in Yongin, Gyeonggi Province. 
The discoveries prompted the Agriculture Ministry and local governments to step up quarantine and biosecurity measures to block a bird flu outbreak among domestic poultry. 
Intertwined with the bird migration season, the officials fear this may be a harbinger of another mass outbreak in the country. Last time it happened, over 6.5 million chickens, ducks and quails were culled. 
`` This is a very alarming situation, '' said Vice Agriculture Minister Lee Jae-ouk in a press briefing on Oct. 26, a day after the first case was reported in Cheonan. 
`` There has been a pattern of poultry farms reporting the highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak soon after cases among migrant birds, '' he said. 
The virus can spread via infected birds ' body fluids or feces to other birds or animals of other species. There are two strains of the virus -- high or low pathogenic viruses. 
It is harder to control than any other pathogens because it is difficult to track and control the movement of birds. Scientists have pointed to migratory birds as potential virus carriers. 
Throughout this year, more than 640 cases of the severe virus strain were discovered in 40 countries, and experts have warned that the virus would eventually reach Korea this winter. 
According to the National Institute of Biological Resources, 575,000 migrant birds of 176 species arrived in Korea in October and more are to come as winter deepens. The total number of migrant birds could be above 1 million throughout this winter, it says. 
Since bird flu was first reported in Korea in 2003, the virus has frequently been transmitted from migrant birds to farmed poultry. 
In Korea's last battle against the disease that spanned from November 2017 to February 2018, 6.54 million poultry chickens, ducks and quails from 140 farms were killed in response to outbreaks at 22 farms raising 1.33 million poultry. 
While bird flu cases have been discovered in Korea since then, all of the cases were verified as low-severity strains. 
The mass culling and following public fears then seriously disrupted the demand for and supply of poultry products like chicken and eggs during the outbreak. Korea had to import eggs from nearby countries to meet the demand for `` safer '' eggs and stabilize egg prices. 
With that in mind, the government last week upgraded its response level to the highest `` serious, '' going all out to prevent an outbreak among commercial flocks. 
`` The Agriculture Ministry, the Environment Ministry and local governments should remain alert and fully concentrate on virus control measures and prevent the avian flu from reaching poultry farms, `` Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun said in a meeting Oct. 25. 
The Environment Ministry's teams are currently inspecting 46 major migrant bird habitats throughout the country and collecting samples to track the virus's spread. 
Local governments such as Cheonan have started using laser pointers to deter migrant birds from reaching nearby poultry farms, and ministries are attaching trackers to wild birds in danger areas to disinfect places they reach. 
The Agriculture Ministry said it is working on action plans, should the virus spread to farmed poultry.

The state government has directed the civic bodies to curb the spread, as birds have been found dead at many places in the city.As per reports, these birds have died due to bird flu, and the fear of the same has spread among the citizens of Mumbai. Owing to this, the traders dealing with eggs and chicken have reported a loss in business and a drop in the price.Market status reveals that the flu is directly affecting chickens and eggs, and the sales have significantly dropped, whereby egg prices have fallen by INR 1, from INR 6 to INR 5, on Monday, January 11, 2021.

2ESPOZODUB,Avian Influenza: Cabinet declares compensation for culled birds,"Avian Influenza: Cabinet declares compensation for culled birds 
Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala government on Wednesday decided to pay compensation to the owners of the hens which were culled as part of the government's precautionary measures following the outbreak of bird flu. 
Authorities had begun culling domesticated birds and hens in Kozhikode district from March 8 amid the reports of bird flu outbreak last week. 
The health authorities culled birds within a one-km raidus of two poultry farms at nearby Vengeri and Kodiyathoor. 
The state Cabinet has decided to give a compensation of Rs 200 for each of the over two-month - old hens, which were culled. 
The hotels in Kozhikode city have decided not to serve chicken dishes until further developments. Poultry shops have also shut down after the sales were stalled. 
`` The owners of the over two-month - old will get compensation of Rs 200 for each of the culled birds, while those of less than two month - old ones will get Rs 100 each. The state will also provide a compensation of Rs five each for the eggs that were destroyed in the area, '' a release issued by the chief minister's office said. 
Nearly 200 trained staff and support members in as many as 25 rapid response squads of five each participated in the process of culling an estimated 12,000 birds mostly chicken besides turkey and love birds on Sunday. 
The officials in protective gear were engaged in the culling operation and the carcasses were burnt. 
To prevent the spread of Avian Influenza, the district collector had on Saturday issued instructions to close all chicken farms, chicken and egg stalls and pet and ornamental bird shops within 10 km of the epicentre farms at Vengeri and West Kodiyathooor. 
The state health department, in association with the Animal Husbandry department and the civic authorities, was involved in the exercise, officials said.

App forwards on coronavirus broke the 1 tn Indian poultry industry 
`` Broiler chicken me korona virus ko paya gaya hai, '' one of them said. `` Tamam logo se appeal ki jati hai ki broiler ke gosht ka istemal na kare ... '' As proof of the virus in chickens, two images of blind, tattered-looking broiler chickens accompanied these. 
Since 2003, Shelke has been running his poultry business alongside his family's fruit and vegetable farms. He sources 4,000-6 ,000 chickens from a hatchery, shelters them in long, airy sheds, and fattens them up with high-density maize and corn feed. The chickens are ready to be sold in six - seven weeks. A batch of 5,000 fetches him around 50,000. 
For many farmers, the poultry business is a way of earning a steady income, especially when agriculture is so vulnerable to the whims of weather. So when Shelke read the text message, he was n't willing to believe it. Only three students from Kerala, who had recently returned to India from China, had been diagnosed with the coronavirus at the time. `` My family was afraid that the rumours might affect our business, '' he says over the phone. `` But I said, it will pass. People will see through them. ''

Besides, this was hardly the first time chickens were getting bad press. Much of the Indian poultry industry has been criticized frequently for housing birds in cramped cages, fattening them on feed ridden with highly potent antibiotics, and for the filthy conditions in which they are kept and slaughtered. When bird flu hit Maharashtra in 2006 and West Bengal in 2008, millions across the country gave up meat for weeks, even months. Even during an outbreak of chikungunya in 2016, some associated the mosquito-born disease with chicken due to assumed phonetic similarities and briefly gave up meat. 
This time, however, the barrage of Whats. 
App forwards warning against poultry consumption only increased. Many posed as guidelines from credible-sounding sources, like the Union health ministry and Unicef, and recommended an assortment of remedies: stay off fizzy drinks, processed foods, animal products, even ice cream. The warnings against diseased chicken became more dire by the day. Pictures and videos of chicken allegedly afflicted by the virus were actively circulated on social media.

In a bid to quell the rumours, the Union health ministry, the animal husbandry ministry and the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India ( FSSAI ) issued statements denying that the virus could be caused by egg or chicken consumption. The Maharashtra government announced it would lodge an FIR against anyone found to be circulating such rumours. But it seemed to make little difference. By the start of March, many farmers across the state were distress-selling their birds for 5 - 10 each, nearly 70 less than a few months earlier. The price of eggs, too, dropped from 48 to 24 a dozen. Conversely, mutton sellers in several parts of the country reported a steep hike in demand. The crisis, claims Suresh Chitturi, vice-president of the All India Poultry Breeders Association, was costing the industry 1.6 billion a day. 
On 8 March, Shelke removed 3,000 live birds from the shed and loaded them atop a tractor trolley. He drove it to a patch of land next to his farm where an excavator had dug a hole a few feet deep. There, he buried them. `` I sprinkled salt over the soil after so it does n't smell, '' he says. It was a decision made out of desperation. There were no takers for his birds. Shelke claims he had already spent nearly 1.5 lakh feeding them over two weeks and could n't afford to continue any longer. `` I would spend more time with the birds than I did with my wife and kids. Imagine how it felt. '' 
Sales have dropped nearly 80 % in parts of the country following the rumours online. ( Photo: Getty Images ) 
In a follow-up interview a few days later, Shelke denies having buried the chickens. `` It would be a crime if I did so, '' he adds uneasily. But his father and poultry supplier separately confirm that he did. `` There have been police complaints filed against farmers killing chicken around here, so many are afraid of admitting it, '' says K.B. Gangavane, a local coordinator with the Pune-based poultry company Shri KY Agrovet Pvt. Ltd -- Shelke rears chickens for them. `` It's like, you ca n't afford to keep them, nor are you allowed to kill them. '' 
Precautio n or paranoia? 
Poultry is the most organized of all animal agriculture sectors in India, with leaders like the VH Group ( better known as Venky's ), Suguna Foods, Godrej Agrovet and Skylark Foods. Nearly 80 % of the eggs and chicken sold in India come from commercial farms. At nearly 80 million, Maharashtra has the third largest poultry population in India. It is where the Whats. 
App rumours are believed to have started. 
Why did the poultry industry become the victim of misinformation? The reasons, say industry stakeholders, are multipronged. They range from people's gullibility to fake news on the internet to their distrust in the food safety norms followed by the industry, as well as the cultural taboos associated with meat in India. 
But first, was there any degree of truth to the rumours at all? Surprisingly, yes. But only because of the broad nomenclature. 
Coronavirus is a group of viruses known to cause respiratory ailments. These include Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ). The ongoing pandemic is of Covid-19, caused by a new type of virus previously not known to medical experts. But many use Covid-19 and coronavirus interchangeably. 
According to a paper published by the US National Institutes of Health's National Library of Medicines, coronaviruses have long been observed in dogs, cats, poultry and livestock and other animals. The one found commonly in chicken is an `` infectious bronchitis virus ''. Research so far has not established any link between the coronavirus found in chickens and Covid-19 in humans. 
`` If the name of the virus is the same in both species, it creates panic, `` says D.D. Parkale, regional joint commissioner of the Maharashtra state animal husbandry department. `` Take influenza, for example. It exists in animals too but is not communicable to humans. Similarly, there is no science to support that coronavirus in chickens is communicable to humans. '' 
On 17 February, Parkale's department lodged a complaint against rumour-mongers with the Pune police cyber crime cell. Over the following weeks, poultry companies in Hyderabad, Gorakhpur and several parts of Maharashtra held `` Chicken Food Festivals '', selling kebabs, curries and biryanis at a subsidized price of 30-90. Aimed at promoting consumption and addressing misconceptions, these saw packed halls with thousands of attendees. Only, not enough to stem the slide. 
`` We saw a similar slowdown during bird flu in 2006, '' says D.H. Kadam, director of Shri KY Agrovet Pvt. Ltd. `` But the difference between then and now is that there is Whats. 
App. '' With internet reaching the remotest corners of India, use of social media has increased multifold, as has the spread of fake news. 
The current crisis is unprecedented in its scale, adds Kadam. In recent years, the poultry industry has seen a boom of 7-8 % per annum. India is now the second largest producer of eggs and fourth largest producer of chicken. Chicken is its most widely consumed meat. In many parts, eggs and chicken are the cheapest source of protein available. Valued at 1 trillion, the poultry industry employs over five million and indirectly supports over 25 million farmers, creating a stock that is largely acceptable to the 70 % Indians who admit to being non-vegetarian. 
Unlike Brazil and the US, where nearly 80 % of meat sold is packaged and processed, the poultry industry in India depends on mostly private butcher shops, known as wet-markets. `` It's because we have a mentality for buying fresh produce, '' says Kadam. `` You select the bird and want it cut for you. Even the meat from the bird served to the customer just before you wo n't do. '' 
Workers at a hatchery in Dahanu, Maharashtra, put newborn chicks in a basket to be transported to poultry farms for rearing. ( Photo: S Kumar/Mint ) 
But `` fresh '' does n't always translate into clean. There have been frequent breaches of guidelines on animal welfare, food safety and hygiene. This time, even as the FSSAI refuted rumours linking the coronavirus to poultry, it said it would start introducing measures to improve hygiene and sanitation in the meat and fish industry. It admitted, the hygiene standards in the sector at present were `` not good ''. 
`` Many meat shops in India operate illegally, '' says Amruta Ubale, senior director of public affairs at Animal Equality India, who has extensively researched the Indian poultry industry. `` They lack adequate infrastructure and do n't follow norms for food safety. There are almost never any checks by veterinarians to assess the health of chicken in the live market. '' 
Some have thus turned to packaged and frozen chicken. Perizaad Zorabian, a model-turned-businesswoman whose company Zorabian Chicken sells packaged, frozen and `` relatively antibiotic-free '' birds, said in a TV interview earlier this month that following the Covid-19 scare, sales of her products were `` kind of skyrocketing ''. 
`` Even a normal man wants to buy branded chicken because he's scared, '' she added. 
There are also cultural reasons for people willing to believe rumours against poultry, says Pushpesh Pant, food historian and writer of India: The Cookbook. `` In my state of Uttarakhand ( and parts of the North-East ), chicken is considered a ` polluted ' meat because it feeds on worms. At temples, it is only sacrificed, not consumed. '' In the current political climate, where an assertive Hindu right seeks to promote vegetarianism, the Indian meat-eater is often made to suffer `` pangs of guilt '', he adds. `` Any disease that might have a non-vegetarian connect gives the Hindu fringe an excuse to call it a curse of god. First it was visiting the Chinese, now the ( meat-eating ) Hindus. '' 
Crisis Management 
When the poultry industry faced a consumption crisis during the bird-flu outbreak, Venky's, one of the industry leaders with interests in chicken breeding, feeding and meat processing, launched a series of advertisements featuring actor Sanjay Dutt. In the ad, Dutt could be seen channelling the histrionics of the lovable rogue of Munna Bhai M.B.B.S, reassuring viewers on the quality of the white meat. `` Apna chicken foreign ko jaata hai ( We export our chicken ), `` he says. `` Firangi sumdi mein kombdi khaata hai ( Foreigners eat it on the sly ). '' 
In the weeks following the slowdown in February, many poultry companies countered the social media rumours with fact-checks on the same platforms, circulating e-copies of advisories issued by health authorities, assuring vexed customers that chicken consumption caused no harm. In early March, a delegation of poultry producers met Sunil Kedar, minister of animal husbandry in Maharashtra. `` Our working capital is exhausted, '' says Prasanna Pedgaonkar, general manager at Venky's, who was part of the visiting delegation. `` There's an urgent need for compensation. We have requested for at least 100 per bird ( it costs 140 to raise a bird for six weeks ). '' 
In late February, ministers from the Telangana government ate chicken at a public event to refute rumours that consumption of poultry products can cause Covid-19. ( Photo: Twitter @vsrinivasgoud ) 
There also need to be strong initiatives that send out a message, he adds. `` For example, if they incorporate eggs in midday meals in public schools, it tells people that chicken is harmless. '' 
On 16 March, the Pune police cyber cell announced that it had identified two people who had circulated rumours linking chicken to coronavirus on You. 
Tube. One was a commerce student from Uttar Pradesh, another ran a watch-repair shop in Andhra Pradesh. Jayram Paigude, inspector at the cyber cell, says preliminary interrogations do not indicate any mischievous intent. `` They did it for the likes, '' he says, somewhat harried. `` Social media ne manus mental jhalae ( People have lost their minds due to social media ). '' 
Earlier this week, this reporter visited Crawford Market, the 150-year-old shopping precinct in south Mumbai, that sells everything from groceries to gift items, pets to poultry. Its butcher shops lie tucked away in a remote, dingy corner. A small army of migrant workers runs the operations, culling, cleaning and chilling meat in the open, to be sold immediately or ferried to caterers and restaurants across Mumbai. 
According to shop owners, Crawford Market is known to sell 50,000 birds every day. Over the past few weeks, they have barely managed to sell 10,000. 
`` It's perhaps because of its easy availability but chicken has always been victimized, '' says Nisar Qureshi, a poultry trader who runs a wholesale and retail shop, Chick Nook, at the Market. `` First it was the steroids, then antibiotics, then lack of hygiene and now coronavirus. There might be a degree of truth to some of it but these Whats. 
App forwards are baseless. '' 
In the past few weeks, says Qureshi, most of his 200-plus restaurant clients have cut back on their orders for fresh meat. On the day we met, he claimed to be selling chicken at 40 a kilogram, a third of what he used to earlier. The outbreak of bird flu in parts of Kerala and Karnataka this week has further dimmed prospects. But Qureshi remains positive. 
`` It's a humongous industry, '' he says. `` And as my forefathers used to tell me, murgi apna bhav khud bolti hai ( a chicken decides its own price ).

2IDF03UO51,"Philippines now free of H5N6 bird flu, but monitoring another strain","MANILA (Reuters) - The Philippines is now free of the highly pathogenic H5N6 bird flu virus, the Department of Agriculture said on Tuesday, citing a declaration by the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE).“As of Jan. 8, the country is now free of the last remaining A(H5N6) strain of the avian Influenza,” having resolved the outbreaks in Pampanga province and a village in Rizal, near the capital region, it said in a statement.However, the Southeast Asian country, a major importer of chicken and other poultry products, was not dropping its guard against the disease, it said.The agriculture department had imposed a temporary ban on the importation of domestic and wild birds and their products from France, South Korea, the Netherlands, and Poland, where another highly pathogenic strain - H5N8 - has been detected.The Philippines is among the world’s biggest meat importers and consumers, with chicken, pork and beef all a mainstay in the Filipino diet.In a report to the OIE, the Bureau of Animal Industry (BAI) - an agency under the agriculture department - said the affected farms in Pampanga and Rizal had shown no further evidence of the presence of the H5N6 virus.“We had not detected any case...among the poultry and other bird population in the last 90 days after the completion of cleaning and disinfection in the affected farms,” BAI Director Ronnie Domingo said.Avian flu outbreaks are a recurring concern for the agriculture department and the local poultry industry, having recorded outbreak cases in 2017 and 2018.Reporting by Enrico Dela Cruz; Editing by Ed Davies",South Korea,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-philippines-birdflu/philippines-now-free-of-h5n6-bird-flu-but-monitoring-another-strain-idUSKBN29O0B5,1611031200,2021-01-19 03:40:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.reuters.com
2KCMB9FEBX,Bird flu spreads to a quarter of Japan prefectures,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s worst bird flu outbreak on record spread to new farms this week and has been found in around a quarter of the country’s 47 prefectures, with officials ordering more cullings.About 32,000 birds will be slaughtered and buried in Sukumo city in Kochi prefecture in southwestern Japan after avian influenza was discovered at an egg farm, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday.More infected birds were found on two farms in Kagawa prefecture, where the poultry epidemic emerged last month, with nearly 30,000 birds being slaughtered there, the ministry said.The outbreak has hit 12 prefectures across Japan and a record 3 million birds have been culled to date.While the ministry said it is not possible for people to catch avian influenza from eating the eggs or meat of infected chickens, health officials around the world are concerned about the virus strain making a “species jump” to humans and causing a pandemic like the novel coronavirus.The outbreak in Japan and neighbouring South Korea is one of two separate highly pathogenic avian influenza epidemics hitting poultry around the world, according the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and Japanese officials.Both the strain circulating in Asia and one spreading rapidly in Europe originated in wild birds, they said.Japan has an egg-laying flock of about 185 million hens and a broiler population of 138 million, according to the ministry of agriculture.Farms in Japan were earlier ordered to disinfect facilities and check hygiene regimes, as well as to ensure that nets to keep out wild birds are installed properly.(Graphic: Japan's birdflu outbreak by prefecture - )Reporting by Aaron Sheldrick; Editing by Tom Hogue",South Korea,https://in.reuters.com/article/health-birdflu/bird-flu-spreads-to-a-quarter-of-japan-prefectures-idINL4N2IW0LF,1608019200,2020-12-15 07:00:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,in.reuters.com
2KZXMDJVHS,New Technology Can Detect Anti-Virus Antibody in 20 Minutes,"New Technology Can Detect Anti-Virus Antibody in 20 Minutes 
The microfluidic device to which 20 μL of samples containing 2 μL of serum will be applied. ( Nishiyama K. et al., Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical. April 21, 2020 ) 
Researchers have succeeded in detecting anti-avian influenza virus antibody in blood serum within 20 minutes, using a portable analyzer they have developed to conduct rapid on-site bio tests. If a suitable reagent is developed, this technology could be used to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV-2, the causative virus of COVID-19. 
Avian influenza is a poultry disease caused by influenza A virus infection. Rapid initial response for a suspected infection and continuous surveillance are essential to mitigate the damage from highly pathogenic, transmittable pathogens such as avian influenza viruses. 
Generally, the polymerase chain reaction ( PCR ) method is used to detect the viral genome, but its complicated procedure requires a considerable amount of time. Another method involves detecting antibodies produced in the body in reaction to virus infection. However, widely used antibody detection methods can be inaccurate because the antibodies ' existence is generally determined by eyesight. 
The newly developed portable fluorescence polarization analyzer ( 35 cm wide, 15 cm high, 15 cm long, and weighs 5.5 kg ) combines a microfluidic device, an optical system, a liquid crystal, and an image sensor, enabling the rapid analysis of multiple samples. ( Nishiyama K. et al., Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical. April 21, 2020 ) 
An image obtained by the device and to be analyzed by the image analyzer. Samples show different degrees of polarization of light depending on the presence, absence, or the amount of anti-H5 avian influenza virus antibodies. ( Nishiyama K. et al., Sensors and Actuators B: Chemical. April 21, 2020 ) 
Professor Manabu Tokeshi ( left ) and the doctoral student Keine Nishiyama ( right ) at Hokkaido University 
The group, including Keine Nishiyama, a doctoral student at Hokkaido University's Graduate School of Chemical Science and Engineering, and Professor Manabu Tokeshi of the university's Faculty of Engineering, conducted this study to develop a new method and analyzer capable of rapid, facile and selective detection of antibodies. The method is based on conventional fluorescence polarization immunoassay ( FPIA ) but applies a different measurement mechanism to make the analyzer much smaller and portable. The analyzer weighs only 5.5 kilograms. 
The combined use of liquid crystal molecules, an image sensor and the microfluidic device makes it possible to simultaneously examine multiple samples and reduces the volume of each sample required. Liquid crystal molecules are capable of controlling the polarization direction of fluorescent light, while the microfluidic device has a number of microchannels as a measurement vessel. 
The group also developed a reagent to detect anti-H5 avian influenza virus antibody, a fluorescein-labeled protein that binds only with the antibody. The reagent was made by reproducing hemagglutinin ( HA ) protein fragments, which are expressed on the surface of H5 avian influenza virus, through gene recombination and by labeling fluorescent molecules to the fragments. 
To make the measurement, serum collected from birds was mixed with the reagent and left for 15 minutes. The mixture was injected into the microfluidic device and measured with the portable fluorescence polarization analyzer. Molecular movements of the reagent bound with the antibody will be smaller in the liquid, producing a different degree of polarization from the reagent not bound with the antibody. The system can detect anti-H5 avian influenza virus antibody with only 2 microliters of serum sample and within 20 minutes. 
`` Our analyzer could be used to conduct other bio tests if suitable reagents are developed, '' says Tokeshi. The group has already successfully detected mycotoxin and drug constituents. `` By reproducing fragments of spike proteins expressed in the novel coronavirus, and using them as the reagent, the analyzer should be able to detect anti-coronavirus antibodies.

2L6PG50RUQ,Departments to prepare for possible bird flu outbreak,"The department of animal husbandry on Tuesday has called a meeting of 11 departments in the district on January 14 to discuss their roles and responsibilities in containing a possible outbreak of avian influenza. While lab reports of two bird samples sent to Jalandhar are awaited, officials said they are operating under the assumption that they will test positive for bird flu, in which case culling of poultry may be required.Thursday’s meeting, to be presided over by Dr Punita Gahlot, the deputy director of animal husbandry, is likely to be attended by the police, public health, forests and wildlife, revenue and land reform, public works, panchayat administration, and the disaster management cell officials, in addition to the deputy commissioner and municipal commissioner. “So far, we have been focussing on conducting clinical surveillance at poultry farms and training our veterinarians. But containing an outbreak requires a lot of coordination among various line departments. For example, the police will be required to provide manpower to field teams when they visit poultry farms. Then, the revenue department is responsible for disbursing monetary compensation to affected farmers whose birds are being culled, and for drawing up epidemic maps and identifying safe burial sites,” said a senior veterinary officer with the district animal husbandry department, seeking anonymity.Similarly, the deputy commissioner will be the nodal authority for ordering a ban, if required, on sale and transport of poultry products, either from the district or from containment zones. The deputy commissioner will also be responsible for coordinating all financial and logistical support for the containment operation, should one be required. The department of public health, meanwhile, will be responsible for monitoring the health of all veterinarians, livestock handlers and safai karmacharis involved in culling of birds, and will also provide them with antiviral drugs as a precaution. The public works department will supply disinfection and fogging machines, and any other heavy infrastructure (such as earthmovers), which may be required for culling and burying carcasses.Department officials, not authorised to speak on the record, also said that they have reached out to the Regional Disease Diagnostic Lab in Jalandhar, requesting them to expedite the test results of two carcasses. “We may receive the sample results in a day or two. If they test positive, we may not begin culling immediately since there is no excess mortality of poultry in Gurugram till today. We may send chicken samples for tests first,” said the veterinary officer cited above.Dr Gahlot declined to comment but confirmed that a meeting to apprise other arms of the district administration has been convened at 11am on Thursday.",#,https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/departments-to-prepare-for-possible-bird-flu-outbreak-101610472677946.html,1610472677,2021-01-12 16:31:17+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.hindustantimes.com
2LZJ97F5EW,UMN receives $1 million for tactical work on agricultural biosecurity,"UMN receives $ 1 million for tactical work on agricultural biosecurity 
The University of Minnesota College of Veterinary Medicine's Secure Food System team collaborate with public and private partners to develop tactical biosecurity strategies to limit disease spread for specific animal movements based on risk-based science. The awarded work pursues these objectives: 

Assess the risk of animal movements and their agricultural products during an outbreak and translate the risk-based science into workable movement permit guidance 
Develop tactical strategies to limit foreign animal disease outbreak spread in integrated agriculture systems 
Conduct outreach on emergency preparedness and the SFS platform 

American agriculture uses a just-in-time delivery model where an egg laid or loin harvested today may be on store shelves tomorrow. When outbreaks happen, movements -- including those from uninfected farms -- may be stopped to prevent disease spread. However, the collateral damage from stopping agricultural product movements may be a larger threat to animal welfare, the food supply, social stability and rural economic viability than the disease itself. 
On May 1, a team of scientists led by Carol Cardona, DVM, PhD; Cesar Corzo, DVM, MS, PhD; Marie Culhane, DVM, PhD; and Tim Goldsmith, DVM, MPH, DACVPM, received $ 1 million from USDA NIFA Agriculture and Food Research Initiative for the team's proposed work involving tactical sciences for agricultural biosecurity. 
This NIFA AFRI program area has long aimed to narrow gaps in food and agricultural defenses and to increase national capacity to prevent, rapidly detect and respond to biological threats to the U.S. food system. In fact, in April, AFRI added funding opportunities for rapid response to the novel coronavirus. 
This project at the CVM, however, was proposed back in September 2019, and sets out to expand upon the already-proven SFS approach, which prevents damage while maintaining food production and access to markets by clarifying infection pathways and developing practical biosecurity measures to mitigate those infection risks. 
In 2015, 2016, and 2017, the SFS strategy was successfully used for poultry-to-market movements during the H5 avian influenza outbreaks because producers and regulators followed the proactively developed guidance in the Secure Poultry Supply plan. In addition, the approach uses scientifically-sound disease detection strategies to support risk-based permitted animal and agricultural product movements from uninfected production premises within outbreak control areas. 
This work will result in several proactive risk assessments -- key components of preparedness planning -- and will provide the scientific basis needed to make live animal and animal product movements during an outbreak. The team behind this project unites scientific colleagues and industry experts with relevant expertise, providing scientifically sound risk-based biosecurity guidance to producers and decision-makers to help prevent infections and limit the size of outbreaks.

Cases of the H5N8 strain of the bird flu have been confirmed in 226 farms in Hungary's southern Bács-Kiskun and Csongrád counties, leading to the culling of 3.5 million animals, the chief veterinary officer said on Monday. In areas where farms stood too close to each other, 870,000 poultry had to be culled to thin the stock and stop the virus from spreading, Lajos Bognár said. The farmers ' damage totals at several billion forints, he said. Facilities operating in line with the relevant regulations are eligible for damages from the state, Bognár said, adding that many have been found to flout a January decree to keep the animals in closed facilities at all times. Bognár noted that bird flu was typically brought into the country by migratory birds, hence the ban on open-air poultry farming.H5N8 first appeared in Asia in 2014, when it developed into a pandemic.

2NPW71HJDS,Steps to check spread of avian influenza in Kottayam,"As avian influenza (H5N8) has been confirmed among ducks in Kottayam, the district administration has initiated steps on a war-footing to prevent the spread of the disease. According to official estimates, the virus killed 1,700 out of 8,000 ducklings which are around 70 days old, in a farm in the 14th ward of Neendoor grama panchayat till Monday.In view of the development, District Collector M. Anjana, who convened an urgent meeting of the officials concerned on Monday, directed the officials to cull the remaining birds in the farm. Culling“An additional flock of 1,000 ducks within the 1-km radius of the infection hotspot will be culled to prevent the spread of the disease. Eight teams have been formed for culling, which will begin on Tuesday morning. As of now, there is no need to panic as the infected birds are in an isolated area surrounded by water and hence chances for the spread are minimal,” she said.“As per expert opinion, the virus will be transmitted to humans only if it gets mutated,” Ms. Anjana added. Following the death of 600 ducks on December 28, the authorities led by District Animal Husbandry Officer Shaji Panickassery visited the farm the next day and sent samples for testing to the Avian Disease Diagnostics Lab (ADDL) at Thiruvalla and later to the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal.Meanwhile, the test result of samples of 20 ducks, which died in a farm in Kudavechoor panchayat, was negative.Awareness campaigns have been started under the leadership of the Health Department to allay the fears of people and ensure preventive action. The Health Department has set up a surveillance system within a 2-km radius of the area where the disease was reported.Further, the district administration has banned the import of ducks or ducklings to the farms and other outlets from outside the district until further notice. The Animal Husbandry Department has sent intimation in this regard to all areas through the veterinary officers concerned. Samples to be collectedSamples of domesticated birds within a 10-km radius of the epicentre of the disease will be collected and tested. Meanwhile, the Social Forestry Department has been tasked to monitor migratory birds in and around Neendoor. If any migratory birds are found to be dying unnaturally, the Animal Husbandry Department should be informed.

Malappuram: In less than a week after bird flu was detected in two poultry farms in Vengeri and west Kodiyathoor in Kozhikode district, the disease has been confirmed in Malappuram, which is 47 km away. 
Collector Jaffer Malik said the disease has been confirmed at Palathingal in Parappangadi in the district and culling activities in one-km radius of the affected area would begin from Saturday. 
An urgent meeting of the officials of the district Animal Husbandry, Health and civic bodies was held here on Thursday. 
Suspecting the outbreak in the farm after a few hens were found dead, the Animal Husbandry officials had on Sunday last collected viscera samples from the farm and sent them for investigation at the National Institute for High Security Animal Disease, Bhopal, and the test turned positive. 
Meanwhile, the culling and disinfecting of one-km radius of the two farms where the outbreak of bird flu was detected in Kozhikode last Saturday entered its second phase 
All the birds and pets within one-km of the epicentre that were hidden or transported to safer places would also be culled by the special task force. 
The hotels in the district have decided not to serve chicken delicacies until a positive development on the issue. The number of people having food from hotels has also reduced. And several hotels reported that their earnings have been reduced by half. 
The death of few bats in Karaserry near west Kodiyathoor is due to some bacterial disease and has nothing to do with either bird flu or Nipah, official sources said. 
Avian influenza was last reported from Kerala in 2016. Thousands of ducks were culled in Alappuzha district then to control the spread of the disease.

The full length of HA was cloned into vector plasmids under the control of a cytomegalovirus promoter. The in-vitro expression of the recombinant HA was demonstrated in He. 
La cells transfected with the plasmids pVAX1-H9 or pCR-H9 using western blot and Immunofluorescent assay ( IFA ). The efficacy of pVAX-H9 and pCR - H9, naked or saponin-adjuvanted, was evaluated in turkey poults at 3 weeks and challenged with A/CK/Egypt / SCU8 / 2014 ( 10 EID/bird at 3 weeks post-vaccination. The efficacy was assesses based on virus shedding, oropharyngeal and cloacal, as well as seroconversion using haemagglutination inhibition ( HI ) test. All immunized birds showed high HI antibody titers ( 7-8 log ) at 3 weeks post-vaccination. None of the birds vaccinated with naked or saponin-adjuvanted pVAX-H9 or pCR-H9 showed any clinical signs. The pVAX-H9 and pCR-H9 alone did not prevent cloacal and oropharyngeal virus shedding, however, saponin-adjuvanted pVAX1-H9 and pCR-H9 prevented cloacal and oropharyngeal virus shedding at 3 and 5 days post challenge, respectively. In conclusion, DNA vaccination with pVAX1-H9 and pCR-H9 could protect turkey from the H9N2 virus, but vaccination regimes need to be improved. Copyright © 2020. Published by Elsevier B.V.

2UW442NARD,A literature review of the use of environmental sampling in the surveillance of avian influenza viruses.,"A literature review of the use of environmental sampling in the surveillance of avian influenza viruses. 
This literature review provides an overview of use of environmental samples ( ES ) such as faeces, water, air, mud and swabs of surfaces in avian influenza ( AI ) surveillance programs, focussing on effectiveness, advantages and gaps in knowledge. ES have been used effectively for AI surveillance since the 1970s. Results from ES have enhanced understanding of the biology of AI viruses in wild birds and in markets, of links between human and avian influenza, provided early warning of viral incursions, allowed assessment of effectiveness of control and preventive measures, and assisted epidemiological studies in outbreaks, both avian and human. Variation exists in the methods and protocols used, and no internationally recognized guidelines exist on the use of ES and data management. Few studies have performed direct comparisons of ES versus live bird samples ( LBS ). Results reported so far demonstrate reliance on ES will not be sufficient to detect virus in all cases when it is present, especially when the prevalence of infection/contamination is low. Multiple sample types should be collected. In live bird markets, ES from processing/selling areas are more likely to test positive than samples from bird holding areas. When compared to LBS, ES is considered a cost-effective, simple, rapid, flexible, convenient and acceptable way of achieving surveillance objectives. As a non-invasive technique, it can minimize effects on animal welfare and trade in markets and reduce impacts on wild bird communities. Some limitations of environmental sampling methods have been identified, such as the loss of species-specific or information on the source of virus, and taxonomic-level analyses, unless additional methods are applied. Some studies employing ES have not provided detailed methods. In others, where ES and LBS are collected from the same site, positive results have not been assigned to specific sample types. These gaps should be remedied in future studies. © 2020 Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. Transboundary and Emerging Diseases published by Blackwell Verlag GmbH. References.

Researchers from the University of Wageningen found a highly pathogenic form of the H5N8 virus in the swans after previous swan infections in Russia and Israel this year. `` The virus was probably introduced to the Netherlands through other ( migratory ) bird species, after which local bird populations became infected.

2W5ZENEF99,IATA: Coronavirus Could Cause a ‘Sizeable’ Traffic Disruption,"IATA: Coronavirus Could Cause a ` Sizeable ' Traffic Disruption 
The novel coronavirus ( 2019 - n. 
CoV ) outbreak in China could cause a `` sizeable disruption '' to passenger traffic, especially for operators in the Asia-Pacific region, though analysis of past pandemic episodes -- such as SARS, the avian flu, and MERS -- indicates that `` any effect on air transport would be temporary, '' the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) said. 
At the height of the SARS outbreak, in May 2013, revenue passenger kilometers ( RPKs ) of Asia-Pacific airlines dropped a staggering 35 percent from their pre-crisis levels but monthly international passenger traffic returned to its pre-crisis level within nine months, according to IATA data. On an annual basis, airlines in the region lost 8 percent of passenger traffic and $ 6 billion in revenues. The MERS Flu in 2015, which was concentrated more in a single country, initially resulted in a sharp slowdown -- a 12 percent drop in monthly RPKs to, from, and within South Korea in the first month of the outbreak. However, air travel volumes began to recover after two months and had returned to pre-outbreak levels within six months. The 2005 and 2013 episodes of avian flu had a much milder and short-lived effect and air travel rebounded quickly as the fears of a global spread of the virus eased, IATA observed. 
`` In the past, the airline industry has proven resilient to shocks, including pandemics, '' the airline trade group concluded, though it acknowledged the adverse timing of the 2019 - n. 
CoV outbreak as it coincided with the Lunar New Year celebrations and China's busiest travel season. Moreover, owing to the very strong growth of the Chinese air transport market over recent years, an additional 450 million passengers fly to, from, and within China per year compared with a decade ago. 
`` The recent health scare reminds us of SARS, '' Association of Asia Pacific Airlines ( AAPA ) director-general Andrew Herdman told AIN. `` It can have an impact on demand even without travel restrictions imposed by governments, '' he said, though he cautioned against drawing early conclusions on the size of the 2019 - n. 
CoV outbreak's effect. `` We learned a lot from SARS, '' he noted. `` A lot of procedures to handle a pandemic are now well established through the World Health Organization, IATA, and other institutions. '' 
The WHO last week convened its emergency committee but has not yet declared the outbreak a public health emergency of international concern. 
Herdman also pointed to the response of China, where both the 2019 - n. 
CoV and SARS originated. In contrast to the SARS outbreak, when Chinese officials hesitated in releasing information, `` they now very quickly did take draconian actions and shared information with health authorities across the world, '' he said. 
IATA over the weekend said it is `` closely monitoring '' developments related to the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan, China, and it remains actively engaged with the WHO, ICAO, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). 
Separately, EASA on Monday issued a safety information bulletin ( SIB ) recommending airlines provide information to crew members on how to manage a case of acute respiratory infection on board an aircraft. It further recommends that airlines and airport operators encourage crew members and airport staff to identify any passengers showing signs of acute respiratory infections who were recently in China or in contact with people coming from China. Airlines performing passenger flights to/from affected countries should equip flights with Universal Protection Kits for crew members assisting with potentially infectious cases. The SIB calls upon airlines and aerodrome operators to collaborate as much as possible with the public health authorities to provide support in tracing passengers who traveled on flights confirmed to have carried someone with a case of a 2019 - n. 
CoV infection. 
Locations with confirmed 2019 - n. 
CoV cases now include mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, Australia, Canada, France, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Singapore, Thailand, South Korea, the U.S., and Vietnam, according to the CDC.

2YMQIT3UWM,RSPCA fears bird flu concerns will see Cheshire chickens abandoned,"THERE are fears that chickens could be abandoned in Cheshire following an increase in ownership during lockdown and concerns around bird flu.

 The RSPCA says many people may have bought chicks earlier in the pandemic – even looking for hens to provide eggs when supermarkets saw food shortages – before realising they could not look after them.

 In Cheshire, the charity dealt with 17 incidents of chicken being abandoned between January and November, and it fears many more could follow.

 Kate Parkes, poultry welfare specialist at the RSPCA, said: ""It’s really important that owners follow Government biosecurity advice to help protect the health of their birds as well as to try and limit the spread of the virus.

 ""All pet poultry owners need to stay vigilant for signs of disease and ill health in their flocks and it’s vital they seek veterinary advice if they have any concerns for their birds.

 ""We’re concerned that worries about bird flu and changes to how we’re allowed to keep hens may lead to more owners abandoning their pets, putting more pressure on rescue centres.""

30QPYF6PJM,"In an Epidemic, a Virologist's Cautionary Tale","In an Epidemic, a Virologist's Cautionary Tale 
Ilaria Capua flopped onto the couch of her brother's apartment in Rome. She stabbed at a bag of prepackaged salad, every cusp on her narrow face pleated in distress. She dreaded having to return to the parliamentary session after lunch and wondered whether it was worth the trouble, this political business. 
Little more than a year earlier, in 2013, Capua, Italy's top avian influenza researcher, had taken a leave of absence as the director of the Division of Biomedical Science at the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie ( IZSVe ) in Padua, to become a member of parliament. Capua was known as the Influenza Diva for her work developing a tool for differentiating between infected and vaccinated birds during two devastating avian flu outbreaks. Capua wanted to use her newfound platform to combat the country's uneasy relationship with science. 
She opened her laptop. In her inbox was an email from a journalist at L'Espresso who wanted to know something about bird flu. She was well known for wanting to put genetic data about bird flu strains into the public domain to speed up the development of vaccines and treatments. In the case of Zika, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome and Ebola, information sharing led to the quick development of viable treatments. But something was n't right. These days we are talking about Ebola, she thought to herself. Why would he want to know about bird flu? The first bird flu outbreak, caused by H7N1, started in 1999 and lasted until 2001. The second, caused by H7N3, occurred between 2002 and 2003. She had already spoken with a prosecutor in 2007 about something like this, but it had passed. Nothing came of it. The outbreak had sickened birds and at least seven poultry farmers. What could this guy want now? 
Either way, Capua was eager to speak about her thoughts on furthering open science, on Italy's `` brain drain '' and mass exodus of researchers and their research funds ( too much red tape at home ), and on a number of initiatives she had planned to announce before the coming general elections. 
She got on the phone and the reporter was instantly interrogatory. 
`` I 'm writing a piece about illegal trafficking of viruses and vaccines, '' he said. `` Do you know Paolo Candoli? '' 
Capua's vision sharpened and the world around her shrunk. Of course she knew Candoli. 
`` There is an investigation into the illegal trafficking of vaccines and viruses, '' he said, `` and you are involved. '' The phone then went silent. 
The story that was eventually published had all the ingredients of a biothriller: Scientists who trafficked in potentially dangerous viruses. Company executives who produced and sold an illegal animal vaccine. Corrupt government officials turning a blind eye. The Italian police report alleged that between 2000 and 2008, a `` criminal organization '' of more than 40 people colluded to profit financially from Italy's fight with avian influenza -- and possibly even helped spread the disease. 
The 400-page report, unpublished but obtained by Newsweek along with 1,300 pages of subsequent court documents, wiretaps and police reports, was the culmination of a 10-year investigation by the Italian Carabinieri. 
The report detailed myriad transactions that included the two previous bird flu outbreaks, in which vaccines were allegedly illegally imported into the country and virus cultures were distributed among researchers without official approval. Further, the report alleged that Capua and her colleagues were seeking to make a profit off the vaccines being developed to stop an outbreak they had created. Candoli, with whom Capua often worked, was implicated in the case and the Italian military police began tapping his phone. 
European Union regulations forbade the use of vaccines to bring avian influenza outbreaks under control, because vaccinated poultry can spread the virus without getting sick, making its spread invisible. Instead, outbreaks are usually stamped out by culling infected flocks, though Capua's technique would make it possible to vaccinate some birds in advance to prevent the mass cullings. The report said that Capua was responsible for `` attempted epidemics '': that she had worked alongside the pharmaceutical giant Merial and ignored the rules by producing an illegal vaccine against H7N1 in 2000 and selling it to Italian farmers eager to save their flocks. Police caught veterinarians administering the unregistered vaccine at a farm in Bagnolo di Sogliano al Rubicone, according to the report. The report quotes a wire-tapped phone conversation, years later, in which Paolo Candoli, a manager at Merial in Italy, asked a colleague `` Did we buy it? '' apparently referring to the deactivated virus to be used for vaccine development. `` Yes, we did, '' the colleague said. `` We bought it in Padua. We paid for it handsomely, as we did with all the strains we bought from her. '' 
Candoli and his colleague were talking about Capua. 
After the story was published, Capua and her husband, Richard, would go into their own `` quarantine '' for years as the prosecutor sat on the case. Her reputation was shattered. She left parliament. But she knew sharing deactivated viruses was n't wrong. It was n't illegal. More importantly, the virus strains the Carabinieri mentioned in their report were all wrong. Eventually the charges were dropped because of Italy's strict statute of limitations and because a judge felt the Carabinieri, the arresting Italian police force, had `` built up accusations that are totally unfounded, '' and were `` difficult to understand. '' That did n't matter. Her life would never be the same. She left Italy. 
`` We ca n't, as a community, kill scientists. That's what they tried to do, '' Capua told me. `` Any one of the doctors now working on COVID could get involved in [ a similar investigation ]. '' She warned her cautionary tale went beyond the current pandemic, that future vaccines, for as yet undiscovered coronaviruses and other infectious diseases, depend on the sharing of viral sequences. 
Capua's story and the race to find a coronavirus vaccine both illustrate how important open science is, but also how easily things can go wrong, either because the science is misunderstood -- or because people are actually acting outside the contours of the law.",#,https://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/biothriller-wasnt-cautionary-tale-being-virologist-during-epidemic,1598886476,2020-08-31 13:07:56+00:00,075a4e9c14,pulitzercenter.org
31O1HSPI8Z,Covid-19 Success Stories: How Hong Kong Curbed the Spread of the Virus,"Covid-19 Success Stories: How Hong Kong Curbed the Spread of the Virus 
At the heart of South East Asia, Hong Kong is something of a canary-in-the-coalmine when it comes to modern epidemics. Ravaged by the H3N2 outbreak in 1968, the epicenter of the bird-flu epidemic in 2002 with 50,000 cases, and the second most effected territory after China during Sars, it has developed unrivalled viral expertise and response mechanisms, which has proved extremely useful in 2020. By January 10th Hong Kong had already identified 38 cases of Covid-19, a first hint at how contagious the disease really was, at a time when Beijing was sticking to the line that no case of Covid-19 had been reported outside of Wuhan ( 59 official cases at the time ). This vigilance proved to be an effective early-warning system for 7.5 million Hong-Kongers, who quickly and prior any pressure from the authorities, began taking extra precautions, such as wearing masks in public. An exemplary attitude which, according to some estimates, reduced the potential rate of infection by 90 %. Schools close and people begin working from home. 
On January 27th, although the number of cases reported in Hong Kong remained small, all schools and creches were closed and people who could were encouraged to start working from home. In addition, an information campaign was launched, designed to advise the populace on how best to protect themselves from Covid-19. All arrivals from the mainland were obliged to spend 14 days in quarantine at their domicile, a hotel or at a center provided by the government for the purpose. This was no easy decision for the autonomous region governed by Carrie Lam, since around 50 million Chinese cross the frontier each year. But it was a necessary one, with the public clamoring for the border to be completely sealed off. In response to the developing global pandemic, additional measures were taken in March, with Hong Kong being shut to all non-resident foreigners, the cavalier attitude of some of Hong Kong's extensive ex-pat community to the wearing of masks having causing a stir, even if the number of new contaminations had always remained low. The peak of contamination in Hong Kong was reached on April 1st. Patients treated as early as possible Hong Kong is a city where rich and poor live shoulder to shoulder, and the country has a system of healthcare for all that is practically free and has, during the coronavirus emergency, proven capable of shouldering the load. An extensive testing programme was put in place, with 96,709 tests carried out between January and mid-March. The quarantine protocol for those entering the country was extended and broadened to include the use of e-bracelets linked to an app entitled Stay Home Safe, which monitors the movements of people under confinement. This proved to be a highly effective tool and allowed the authorities to stay one step ahead of the outbreak and prevent new clusters from forming. In addition, rather than see the hospitals having to deal with a large number of advanced cases of Covid-19, the government decided that each patient should be admitted to hospital as soon as possible so that the virus could be treated at an early stage. Hong Kong's doctors have tested, with moderate success, a combination of three antiviral drugs on patients: the anti-HIV drug Lopinavir/Ritonavir, the adenovirus treatment Ribavirine and multiple sclerosis medication Interferon beta-1b. A study by Hong Kong doctors, published in The Lancet, showed that, on average, Covid-19 patients felt better after four days and exhibited no side effects. In addition, those treated with this cocktail test negative for the coronavirus after an average of seven days, as against 12 when receiving Lopinavir/Ritonavir alone. Promising results, which underline the importance of acting early when confronted with a disease whose symptoms can take time to manifest. A larger sample size will, of course, be needed to confirm the efficacy of this treatment. Victory is declared. 
An anticipated second wave of the coronavirus turned out to be a trickle, limited to 13 new cases by mid-April, of which 10 were imported. This means that Hong Kong can, save in the unlikely event of a third wave, effectively declare victory, and we can say that the metropolis has broken with its heavy history where viral outbreaks are concerned. With only four deaths linked to Covid-19, as against 300 during Sars in 2013 ( a disease, it should be noted, which was much less contagious ), Hong Kong's success in curbing the spread of the virus has been nothing short of amazing. But despite this public-health victory, dark clouds remain on the horizon, in the shape of political pressure which China continues to assert on the autonomous region, which sparked last year's anti-extradition protests, not to mention the ever-present threat from new diseases, such as Hepatitus E, which has already been contracted by scores of Hong-Kongers in recent months.",South East Asia,https://www.leadersleague.com/en/news/covid-19-success-stories-how-hong-kong-curbed-the-spread-of-the-virus,1589994780,2020-05-20 15:13:00+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.leadersleague.com

While the world deals with Covid-19, authorities are battling another disease outbreak in Vietnam. 

The H5N6 bird flu has reared its ugly head in several farms there forcing farmers to kill thousands of animals. 

According to a Reuters report, the country had proceeded to cull thousands of birds, mostly chicken and ducks, to contain the outbreak of the highly pathogenic disease. 
Farms disinfected as well 

Other than culling the birds, authorities have also disinfected farms and banned the transport of poultry from infected zones. 

`` We are concerned that the virus may spread further, and are trying our best to stop the outbreak, '' said one of Vietnam's agriculture ministry official to Thanh Hoa newspaper as reported by Reuters. 

According to WebMD, bird flu is spread from bird to bird and is deadly to humans and other mammals that catch the virus from infected birds. 

H5N6 does not spread easily from human-to-human, but the previous strain H5N1 killed nearly 60 % of infected people since the first human case was reported in 1997.",#,https://www.rojakdaily.com/news/article/8654/h5n6-bird-flu-thousands-of-birds-culled-in-vietnam,1582071553,2020-02-18 23:19:13+00:00,075a4e9c14,www.rojakdaily.com

In Reddit Tumblr Email ( © niroworld -- stock.adobe.com ) Backyard poultry flocks are increasingly popular as people explore ways to raise their own food and become more self-reliant amid the pandemic. Fueled by food shortages at the supermarket and people cooped up at home, backyard chickens are taking off. Hatcheries nationwide are reporting record sales, and weekslong waiting lists have them scrambling to meet demand. `` We 're receiving more inquiries about backyard poultry production, '' said Tony Banks, senior assistant director of agriculture, development and innovation for Virginia Farm Bureau Federation. `` Farm supply stores are continuing to sell chicks and ducklings well into the summer beyond the typical springtime peak. '' Raising backyard chickens is a sustainable way to produce locally sourced food without requiring much space. While it can be fun and educational, `` owners should be aware that poultry can sometimes carry harmful germs that make people sick, '' Banks said. Proper biosecurity and flock care are essential, as some birds can spread diseases like salmonella. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently reported a multistate outbreak of salmonella infections linked to backyard flocks. As of June 23, 465 people in 42 states have been infected from touching and handling live poultry. In addition, `` backyard flocks can have a major impact on commercial poultry by serving as a reservoir for poultry diseases such as avian influenza, which can easily be spread, '' Banks explained. The last major U.S. outbreak of avian flu was in 2014 and cost the poultry industry more than $ 1 billion and took over a year to mitigate, Banks added. For anyone considering starting a backyard flock, he recommended purchasing poultry from dealers or farms that participate in the National Poultry Improvement Plan. Those businesses must meet certain flock health and sanitation standards. To keep households and property safe, follow biosecurity practices such as washing your hands before and after handling chickens, and isolating birds from visitors and other animals. Ensure poultry areas are clean, and prevent germs from spreading by disinfecting shoes, tools, equipment and anything used to transport chickens like vehicles and cages. Also, know the warning signs of infectious bird diseases, and watch your flock for early signs, Banks cautioned. Report sick birds to a local Virginia Cooperative Extension office, local veterinarian, the Virginia Office of Veterinary Services or the U.S. Department of Agriculture Veterinary Services office.
