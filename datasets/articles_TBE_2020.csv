5CMU4ULN4Y,Avalanches kill 10 in mountainous area near IranвЂ™s capital,"The Canadian PressBeijing has urged residents not to leave the city during the Lunar New Year holiday in February, implementing new restrictions after several coronavirus infections last week.Two domestic cases were reported on Friday, a convenience store worker and a Hewlett Packard Enterprise employee. Another two asymptomatic cases were discovered in Beijing earlier in the week.Beijing is conducting testing on a limited scale in the neighbourhoods and workplaces where the cases were found.To contain any new outbreaks, the Beijing government cancelled big gatherings such as sports events and temple fairs. It says applications will be strictly reviewed for any major events. Venues such as cinemas, libraries and museums have to operate at 75% capacity, the government said.It also called on companies not to arrange business trips outside the city and abroad.Lunar New Year is Feb. 12.Separately, officials in the northeastern port city of Dalian said Friday that they had tested over 4.75 million people for the coronavirus after 24 confirmed infections this month.Authorities have shut schools and all public spaces in five neighbourhood divisions in Dalian, and only essential workers can leave their compounds to go to work.Elsewhere in the Asia-Pacific region:вЂ” JapanвЂ™s health ministry said Saturday it has confirmed a variant of the coronavirus that has spread across Britain in two Tokyo residents вЂ” the first two cases of the new variant found outside of Japanese airports. A man in his 30s tested positive for the new variant Saturday after returning from Britain on Dec. 16, the ministry said in a statement. A second patient is a woman in her 20s who is related to the man. The confirmation come a day after the ministry said it had detected the first cases of the variant in five returnees from Britain who tested positive when they arrived at Japanese airports between Dec. 18 and Dec. 21. Also Saturday, Tokyo confirmed 949 new cases of the coronavirus, a record high for the Japanese capital, as the country struggles with an upsurge that is spreading nationwide. The Tokyo Metropolitan Government said the additional cases bring the prefectural total to 55,851. Japan had 3,823 new cases Friday for a national total of 213,547, with 3,155 deaths, the health ministry said.вЂ” South Korea has reported another 1,132 coronavirus cases as the resurgence worsened over the Christmas week, putting pressure on the government to enforce stricter social distancing controls. The figures on Saturday brought the countryвЂ™s caseload to 55,902 with 793 deaths. Around 780 of the new cases were from the greater capital area, home to 26 million people, where health workers discovered a large cluster in a huge Seoul prison with more than 500 inmates and workers. Transmissions in recent weeks have also been tied to hospitals, nursing homes, churches, restaurants and army units. After months of complacency, government officials restored some distancing restrictions in recent weeks after easing them to the lowest tier in October and are now clamping down on private gatherings, shutting down ski resorts, restricting hotel occupancy and setting fines for restaurants if they accept large groups. The government will hold a meeting on Sunday to determine whether to elevate distancing controls to the highest вЂњTier-3,вЂќ which could possibly shutter hundreds of thousands of non-essential businesses. Officials have resisted such action for weeks, saying it could unleash further shock on an already weak economy.вЂ” Health officials in Thailand say two new clusters of coronavirus cases have been found that appear to be linked to a major outbreak discovered a week earlier among migrant workers in an industrial province near Bangkok. The new cases were found in 19 members of a motorcycling club who held a holiday gathering on Lanta island in the southern province of Krabi, and in nine people who were in a gambling den in the eastern province of Rayong. On Saturday morning, 110 new coronavirus cases were reported, bringing ThailandвЂ™s total to 6,020. Sixty of the 110 were linked to the outbreak among migrant workers.___Follow APвЂ™s coverage at https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemic, https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccine and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreakThe Associated Press",https://ca.news.yahoo.com/avalanches-kill-10-mountainous-area-062639334.html,"near Bangkok, southern Krabi, eastern province of Rayong, South Korea",,27/12/2020 14:58,2020-12-27 06:18:00+00:00,ee94b68e6e0f,ca.news.yahoo.com,,1609053480,EN
5CU0N7S97R,Alberta paramedics push for place on COVID-19 vaccine priority list,"CBCOntario announced on Saturday its first two confirmed cases in the province of the COVID-19 variant, first identified in the United Kingdom. Ontario is the first province to identify the new COVID-19В variant. The confirmed cases identified are from a couple from Durham Region with no known travel history, exposure or high-risk contacts, Dr. Barbara Yaffe, Ontario's associate chief medical officer of health, saidВ in a news release on Saturday. Durham Region is east of Toronto. Both individuals have been informed and are now in self-isolation as per public health protocols, it said. ""This further reinforces the need for Ontarians to stay home as much as possible and continue to follow all public health advice, including the provincewide shutdown measures beginning today,"" YaffeВ said. ""Durham Region Health Department has conducted case and contact investigation and Ontario is working in collaboration with our federal counterparts at the Public Health Agency of Canada."" TheВ variant has now been detected in multiple countries beyond Britain, including Denmark, Belgium, Australia and the Netherlands. With inbound international travel, it is not unexpected to have identified the new variant in Ontario, the news release said. No evidence new variant more severe: PHAC The federal governmentВ currently has aВ monitoring program in place with the provinces and territories to identifyВ new COVID-19 variantsВ in the country, such as the ones identified in the United Kingdom and South Africa. ""While early data suggests that these new variants may be more transmissible, to date there is no evidence that they cause more severe disease or have any impact on antibody response or vaccine effectiveness,"" the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) said in a statement on Saturday. ""More research is required to confirm these findings, and the Canadian and global medical, public health and research communities are actively evaluating these mutations."" As monitoring continues, PHAC saysВ it is expected that other cases of this variant, along withВ other variants of concern,В will be found in Canada. ""Furthermore, as these two cases did not travel outside of Canada, it is important to follow public health measures and limit contacts with others, to reduce the transmission of the virus and any of its variants in communities,"" it said. ""Recognizing the potential increased risk that inbound international travellers may pose with this new variant, the province continues to call on the federal government to urgently partner with Ontario to implement testing at Toronto Pearson International Airport."" Earlier this week, Ontario Premier Doug Ford said the federal government wasn't doing enough to protect Ontario from international travellers, suggesting they'reВ a problematic source of COVID-19 spread in the province. However, based on the provincial government's own statistics, travel-related COVID-19 cases represent a small number of infections. ""Regardless of whether federal support is forthcoming, the Ontario government is prepared to act on its own to implement an airport testing program,"" the news release said. Ontario under provincewide lockdown starting Saturday Ontario entered a provincewide lockdownВ at 12:01 a.m. on Boxing Day in a bid to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The province has reported more than 2,000 cases 12 days in a row, including 2,142 new positive tests on Saturday and 2,159 cases onВ Christmas Day.

LJOMHI8JLB,Most dangerous countries from diseases for US travelers named,"Most dangerous countries from diseases for US travelers named 
Research has revealed which countries pose the greatest threat to the American travelers from diseases. 
Data1 from the World Health Organization ( WHO ) shows the worst countries for disease outbreaks, with a number of hotspots revealed across the world alongside the threat of COVID-19. 

The study, Wrath of Diseases, delves into 24 years and more than 2,800 disease outbreaks to reveal the most common infectious diseases and the countries that pose the biggest threats. 
High Risk Countries 

Data shows that six of the top 10 countries which have the highest number of outbreaks are in Africa, with a combined 1,060 outbreaks happening in the continent over the last three decades. 
The WHO defines an outbreak as the occurrence of disease cases over normal expectancy caused by an infection, transmitted through person-to-person contact, animal-to-person contact, or from the environment or other media2. 
The country with the highest risk is the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 242 outbreaks recorded in the African nation since 1996. Throughout 2020, as well as dealing with the threat of Covid-19, DR Congo has battled 110 cases of Ebola which has led to 47 deaths. 
China, which reported the first instance of Covid-19, has seen 184 outbreaks in the last 24 years, followed by Indonesia ( 147 outbreaks ), Egypt ( 114 outbreaks ), and Uganda ( 77 outbreaks ) also making up the top five countries. 
Ranked at number eight, the US has had 52 reported outbreaks since 1996, with more outbreaks reported than neighboring countries, Canada ( 21 outbreaks ) and Mexico ( 9 outbreaks ). 
Table of most dangerous countries: 

The data also reveals that there are 26 countries that have only had one outbreak in the past three decades with the Caribbean ranked as one of the safest areas in the world. 
The six luxury destinations of Barbados, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, St Lucia, St Martin, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago have seen only one disease outbreak each since 1996. 
Global Recurring Outbreaks 
While outbreaks in the US are actually ranked as some of the most common around the globe, thankfully some of the more widespread and lethal outbreaks are less likely to be found in America and its neighbouring countries. 
Across the globe, the most frequent outbreak in the last 24 years has been Avian influenza which has seen 607 outbreaks. This is followed by Middle East respiratory syndrome ( MERs ) with 298 outbreaks, Ebola ( 295 ), Cholera ( 279 ), and Yellow Fever ( 167 ). 

Most Common US Outbreaks 
The research also provides a breakdown of which outbreaks have been the most prominent in the US over the three decades. 
Anthrax has been the most common outbreak across the nation with 16 registered incidences, the US reported an outbreak in 2001 which resulted in five deaths among 23 cases. Anthrax is a disease caused by a bacterium ( Bacillus anthracis ) and people can get sick with anthrax after encountering infected animals or animal products. It has also been associated with acts of bioterrorism via contaminated mail. 
The second most common is West Nile disease which has seen 11 outbreaks across the country and, in 2002, was responsible for 211 deaths with 3,587 cases across 39 states. This is followed by Swine Flu with four outbreaks, Zika Virus ( 3 ), and St Louis Encephalitis ( 2 ). 
Important reasons to note for these global outbreaks include climate change, for example, extreme weather events such as storms and floods are often followed by an increase in infectious diseases. 
Outbreaks of diarrheal and respiratory illnesses can occur when access to clean water and sewage systems are disrupted and people are living in crowded conditions. 
A temperature rise may also increase the spread of vector-borne infections such as malaria, dengue, Zika, and yellow fever. Other factors such as urbanization, population growth and an increase in antimicrobial resistance will also impact the spike in outbreaks arising. 
Certain areas of the world are also experiencing rapid population growth. For example, the population of Sub-Saharan Africa, for instance, is increasing at a rate of 2.65 % per year -- more than twice the highest rate of population growth experienced by high-income countries since the 1950s. 
Rapidly growing populations may increase the risk of infection due to poor sanitation, high population density and limited healthcare access. 
It is very difficult to predict, however it is likely that new diseases will continue to emerge. The greatest challenge may be anticipating the next new infection and the difficulty in containing the spread of these infections.",https://www.eturbonews.com/1672704/most-dangerous-countries-from-diseases-for-us-travelers-named/,#,,15/11/2020 16:44,2020-11-12 23:36:23+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,www.eturbonews.com,,1605227783,EN
E4EK7I7YOV,First-of-Its-Kind Synthetic DNA Vaccine Tested Against Powassan Virus,"First-of-Its-Kind Synthetic DNA Vaccine Tested Against Powassan Virus 
Scientists at The Wistar Institute have designed and tested the first-of-its-kind synthetic DNA vaccine against Powassan virus ( POWV ), targeting portions of the virus envelope protein. A rapidly reemerging tick-borne disease, POWV has been reported to be fatal in 10 % of infected people with detrimental neurological consequences including encephalitis and meningitis. This new POWV vaccine candidate, described in a paper published today in PLOS Neglected Infectious Diseases, is one of many emerging infectious disease DNA vaccine discoveries being advanced by the Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at The Wistar Institute. Unlike the widely recognized Lyme disease, POWV causes a little known, potentially deadly infectious disease that is transmitted through tick bites during fall and spring seasons. POWV is an RNA virus belonging to the flavivirus family, the same as Zika virus, but passed to people by ticks instead of mosquitoes. Transmission can occur rapidly and symptoms including flu-like fever, body aches, skin rash, and headaches can present anytime during the 1 - 4 week incubation period. Although still considered relatively rare, in recent years the number of reported cases of people sick from Powassan virus has been increasing in North America, including infecting former U.S. Senator Kay Hagan who contracted Powassan virus and died from the disease. There are no vaccines or therapies available to treat or prevent this emerging infection. Kar Muthumani, Ph.D., former associate professor and director of the Laboratory of Emerging Infectious Diseases at The Wistar Institute, * and senior author on the study, collaborated with the laboratory of David B. Weiner, Ph.D., executive vice president and director of Wistar's Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center, to design and test this synthetic DNA vaccine. The effectiveness of this vaccine was evaluated in preclinical studies that showed a single immunization elicited broad T and B cell immune responses in mice similar to those induced naturally in POWV-infected individuals, and that vaccine-induced immunity provided protection in a POWV challenge animal model. `` The significant protection in mice demonstrated by our vaccine is highly encouraging and strongly supports the importance of this vaccine approach for further study, '' said Muthumani. Residents of and visitors in POWV-endemic areas are considered at risk of infection, especially during outdoor work and recreational activities. In the U.S., cases of POWV disease have been reported in Northeastern states and the Great Lakes region. `` Given the risk of serious complications from POWV and the 300 % increase in incidence of POWV infection over the past 16 years, we will continue efforts to advance this urgently needed emerging infectious disease vaccine candidate towards the clinic, '' said Weiner.

R3JZWMVU4C,Everything the Soviets did wrong in Afghanistan,"The global death toll from the coronavirus has neared 27,000 with more than 591,000 infections confirmed, causing mass disruptions as governments continue to try to slow the spread of the new respiratory illness.
HereвЂ™s a roundup of developments in RFE/RLвЂ™s broadcast countries.

Ukraine
Ukraine says it has confirmed 92 new coronavirus cases as the country begins to impose new restrictions at its borders in the battle to contain the effects of the global pandemic.
The Health MinistryвЂ™s Center for Public Health said that with the new infections, there were 310 confirmed cases of the COVID-19 respiratory illness as of the end of March 27.
Since the crisis began, five deaths have been attributed to COVID-19, with patientsвЂ™ ages ranging from 33 to 71 years.
The jump in new cases comes on the eve of new measures ordered by the government.
President Volodymyr Zelenskiy in an online video address to the nation explained the countryвЂ™s decision to shut cross-border travel after March 27, including for Ukrainian nationals.
Previously, the cabinet had issued a nationwide directive limiting passengers in all public transportation. All above-ground transportation such as, minibuses, buses, trolleybuses, and trams should only ride up to half capacity.
Russia
The Kremlin says a member of President Vladimir PutinвЂ™s administration has been infected with the coronavirus, but the person had not been in direct contact with RussiaвЂ™s leader.
The announcement came as the government widened restrictions aimed at fighting the disease, ordering all restaurants and cafes to close, beginning March 28.
As of March 27, the countryвЂ™s total number of confirmed cases was 1,036, up 196 from a day earlier. Another reported death on March 27 increased the total to four.
According to MoscowвЂ™s coronavirus-response headquarters, the 56-year-old woman who died on March 27 was also suffering from cancer and had one lung removed during an earlier operation.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian news agencies that a man working in the presidential administration had been infected with the coronavirus.
вЂњIndeed, a coronavirus case has been identified in the presidential administration,вЂќ Peskov was quoted as saying.
вЂњAll necessary sanitary and epidemiological measures are being taken to prevent the virus from spreading further. The sick man did not come into contact with the president,вЂќ he added, saying this was the only known case at the Kremlin.
He gave no further details.
As RussiaвЂ™s confirmed cases have climbed, the government has steadily increased the restrictions and other measures seeking to curtail the diseaseвЂ™s spread.
Putin has called for a weeklong work holiday, ordering all nonessential businesses to close down for a week, beginning March 28.
In the order released by Prime Minister Mikhail MishustinвЂ™s government on March 27, regional authorities across the country were instructed to вЂњhalt the activities of public food service organizations.вЂќ The restrictions will take effect on March 28.
The government has also ordered all vacation and health resorts closed until June. Other restrictions included the cancellation of all international flights.
In RussiaвЂ™s capital and largest city, Moscow, city authorities have encouraged people to stay home and placed restrictions on public transit.
The majority of confirmed cases are in Moscow.
The Russian media regulator, meanwhile, said the social messaging network Twitter has deleted a post that it said contained false information about a pending curfew.
Roskomnadzor said it filed a request with the U.S. company on March 26, asking for the post to be taken down.
According to the regulator, the post made mention of a pending order by the Defense Ministry that a curfew was to be imposed in Moscow. That information is false, Roskomnadzor said in a statement on March 27.
Twitter had no immediate comment on the statement by Roskomnadzor.
The Prosecutor-GeneralвЂ™s Office, meanwhile, said officials had made similar requests about allegedly false information circulating on other social media outlets, including Facebook and VK.
Facebook вЂњremoved the incorrect, socially significant information concerning the number of coronavirus cases,вЂќ Roskomnadzor said.
Iran
Iran reported 144 new coronavirus deaths as authorities continued to struggle to contain the outbreak, with the number of confirmed cases jumping by nearly 2,400.
The new tally, announced on March 27 by Health Ministry spokesman Kianoush Jahanpour, pushed IranвЂ™s total confirmed cases to at least 32,332.
Iran is one of the worst-hit countries in the world, along with China, Italy, Spain, and now the United States.
Earlier this week, authorities enacted a new travel ban after fears that many Iranians had ignored previous advice to stay at home and cancel travel plans for the Persian New Year holidays that began on March 20.
On March 25, government spokesman Ali Rabiei warned about the danger of ignoring the travel guidelines.
вЂњThis could cause a second wave of the coronavirus,вЂќ Rabiei said.
State TV, meanwhile, reported that the military has set up a 2,000-bed hospital in an exhibition center in the capital, Tehran, to shore up the local health-care system.
President Hassan Rohani has pledged that authorities will contain the spread of the coronavirus within two weeks. However, the continued rise in numbers, along with fears that the countryвЂ™s health-care system is incapable of dealing with the surge of infections, have raised doubts about meeting that goal.
Earlier this week, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei refused U.S. aid and seized on a conspiracy theory that the United States had created the virus, something for which there is no scientific evidence.
Om March 27, Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged the United States to release Iranians held in U.S. jails on sanctions-related issues due to fears about the coronavirus epidemic.
вЂњRelease our men,вЂќ Zarif said on Twitter.
The minister referred to a report by the Guardian newspaper about an Iranian science professor who it said remained jailed by U.S. immigration authorities after being acquitted in November 2019 on charges of stealing trade secrets related to his academic work.
The professor, Sirous Asgari, complained that conditions in detention were вЂњfilthy and overcrowdedвЂќ and that officials were вЂњdoing littleвЂќ to prevent the coronavirus outbreak, according to The Guardian.
Iranian authorities have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual citizens over recent years, mostly on espionage charges.
Rights activists have accused Iranian authorities of arresting them to try to win concessions from other countries вЂ” a charge dismissed by Tehran.
Serbia
Three people in Serbia have been sentenced to jail for violating a self-isolation order aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus.
The two- to three-year sentences were handed down during a video court session, a first in the Balkan country. The session was conducted remotely to protect employees and defendants from potential exposure to the coronavirus.
One of the defendants was sentenced to three years in prison вЂ” the maximum вЂ” in the eastern town Dimitrovgrad, a Serbian justice source confirmed to RFE/RL. The others were sentenced at a court in the city of Pozarevac to two and 2 1/2 years.
Dragana Jevremovic-Todorovic, a judge and spokeswoman for the court in Pozarevac, told RFE/RL that the two people convicted there had been charged with a criminal offense of noncompliance with health regulations.
вЂњThey violated the measure of self-isolation when they came from abroad. One arrived in Serbia on March 14, the other on March 17, both from the Hungarian border crossing,вЂќ she said.
вЂњThey were informed that they had been given a measure of self-isolation and a restraining order, which they did not respect. The measure was to last 14 days, and they violated it before the deadline,вЂќ Jevremovic-Todorovic said.
вЂњBy violating self-isolation, they have created a danger to human health, as this can spread the infectious disease,вЂќ Jevremovic-Todorovic said.
The Ministry of Justice on March 26 sent a memo to courts that conduct proceedings against people who violate self-isolation measures, allowing them to hold trials remotely using Internet-enabled computers, cameras, and microphones.
The judiciary noted that the first-time video judgments were not final, but the defendants remain in custody while they await trial.
According to the Justice MinistryвЂ™s Criminal Sanctions Directorate, 111 people are in custody at detention facilities in three Serbian cities вЂ“ Pirot, Vrsac, and Pozarevac вЂ” on suspicion of violating the emergency public-health order.
Serbia has recorded 528 coronavirus cases and eight deaths. Restrictive measures introduced by Belgrade include a ban on people over age 65 leaving their homes and a 12-hour overnight curfew enforced by police.
Meanwhile, Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic pledged on March 27 to donate 1 million euros (id=вЂќlisticle-2645588735вЂі.1 million) to buy ventilators and other medical equipment for health workers in Serbia.
вЂњUnfortunately, more and more people are getting infected every day,вЂќ Djokovic told Serbian media.
The world menвЂ™s No. 1 player, who was in top form before the pandemic interrupted the current season, thanked medical staff around the world for their efforts.
Georgia
GeorgiaвЂ™s government has canceled a id=вЂќlisticle-2645588735вЂі.2 million contract to buy thousands of rapid-result coronavirus tests from a Chinese company.
The cancellation is the latest controversy for Bioeasy, whose test kits have been deemed faulty in Spain and returned.
GeorgiaвЂ™s order for 215,000 rapid-result tests also will be returned to Bioeasy, based in the Shenzhen region, near Hong Kong.
Health Minister Ekaterine Tikaradze told reporters on March 27 that Bioeasy had agreed to take them back.
Rapid-result tests, which can be used for diseases like influenza as well as coronavirus, are known for providing quick results, though with less accuracy.
In Spain, which is one of the countries worst-hit by the coronavirus, health officials found the tests were far less accurate than needed, and ordered the tests returned.
Tikaradze said Georgians should not be afraid of being misdiagnosed.
She said new diagnostic tests were being examined at TbilisiвЂ™s Lugar Center for Public Health Research, a medical research facility funded mostly by the U.S. government.
вЂњI want to reassure our population,вЂќ she said. вЂњAny new tests coming into the territory of Georgia are being tested at the Lugar Center and hence we are testing the reliability of the tests and then using them for widespread use.вЂќ
Georgia has 81 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, and no deaths, as of March 27.
Azerbaijan
Azerbaijan has tightened its quarantine rules from March 29 in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.
The movement of vehicles between regions and cities across the country will be banned, with some exceptions, including ambulances, social services, and agricultural vehicles, the government said on March 27.
BakuвЂ™s subway system will operate only five hours a day.
Restaurants, cafes, tea houses, and shops вЂ” except supermarkets, grocery stores, and pharmacies вЂ” will remain closed.
Access to parks, boulevards, and other recreation areas will be restricted.
The South Caucasus country has reported 165 coronavirus cases, with three deaths. Officials say 15 patients have recovered.
In addition, more than 3,000 people remain in quarantine.
On March 26, Azerbaijani authorities extended holidays related to Persian New Year celebrations until April 4, from a previous end date of March 29.
Hungary
HungaryвЂ™s prime minister has ordered new restrictions to try and curtail the spread of the coronavirus, calling for Hungarians to remain at home for two weeks.
In a March 27 announcement on state radio, Viktor Orban said people would only be allowed to travel to work and make essential trips to buy food or medicine or take children to daycare until April 11.
He also proposed special shopping hours at food stores for people 65 and over, and called on people to observe вЂњsocial distancingвЂќ вЂ” staying about 2 meters away from other people to prevent the spread of infection.
Hungary currently has 300 confirmed cases of the coronavirus, though Orban has said the actual number of cases is likely much higher.
Ten infected people have died.
Orban has increasingly tightened his grip on power during his decade in office. Opposition leaders and critics have accused him of moving the country towards an autocracy.
Kazakhstan
KazakhstanвЂ™s government has widened restrictions in the countryвЂ™s two largest cities, ordering most companies to suspend operations next week as part of efforts to curtail the spread of the coronavirus.
The restrictions, announced March 27, came as the number of confirmed cases announced by the government reached 120. Most of the cases are in the capital, Nur-Sultan, and Almaty, KazakhstanвЂ™s largest city.
A day earlier, as the country reported its first death from COVID-19, the government barred residents of Nur-Sultan and Almaty from leaving their homes except for work or to buy food or medicines, starting from March 28.
The closure of most businesses in the two cities also takes effect March 28.
Authorities have also closed all intercity transport terminals and public spaces in Shymkent, KazakhstanвЂ™s third-largest city, in order to curb the spread of coronavirus, the government said.
Uzbekistan
In neighboring Uzbekistan, officials announced the countryвЂ™s first death from coronavirus: a 72-year-old man in the city of Namangan who had suffered from other ailments.
As of early March 27, Uzbekistan вЂ” Central AsiaвЂ™s most populous nation вЂ” has confirmed 75 cases of infection.
Earlier, municipal authorities announced restrictions in Samarkand and the Ferghana valley cities Namangan and Andijon on March 26.
All vehicle traffic in and out of the cities has been restricted, with the exception of cargo transport, or security and government officials.
Tashkent has been closed to the entry and exit of all passenger transport since March 24.
Kyrgyzstan
Another Central Asian country, Kyrgyzstan, announced 14 new cases on March 27, bringing the countryвЂ™s total to 58.
Earlier this week, authorities declared a state of emergency in the capital, Bishkek, and several other cities and regions.
Two other Central Asian countries, Turkmenistan and Tajikistan, have not reported any confirmed infections yet.

6N5NFV963U,Powassan virus: New synthetic DNA vaccine designed and tested,"Powassan virus: New synthetic DNA vaccine designed and tested 
Scientists at The Wistar Institute have designed and tested the first-of-its-kind synthetic DNA vaccine against Powassan virus ( POWV ), targeting portions of the virus envelope protein. A rapidly reemerging tick-borne disease, POWV has been reported to be fatal in 10 % of infected people with detrimental neurological consequences including encephalitis and meningitis. This new POWV vaccine candidate, described in a paper published today in PLOS Neglected Infectious Diseases, is one of many emerging infectious disease DNA vaccine discoveries being advanced by the Vaccine and Immunotherapy Center at The Wistar Institute.

Unlike the widely recognized Lyme disease, POWV causes a little known, potentially deadly infectious disease that is transmitted through tick bites during fall and spring seasons. POWV is an RNA virus belonging to the flavivirus family, the same as Zika virus, but passed to people by ticks instead of mosquitoes. 
The Lyme disease interviews 
Transmission can occur rapidly and symptoms including flu-like fever, body aches, skin rash, and headaches can present anytime during the 1 - 4 week incubation period. Although still considered relatively rare, in recent years the number of reported cases of people sick from Powassan virus has been increasing in North America, including infecting former U.S. Senator Kay Hagan who contracted Powassan virus and died from the disease. There are no vaccines or therapies available to treat or prevent this emerging infection.

The effectiveness of this vaccine was evaluated in preclinical studies that showed a single immunization elicited broad T and B cell immune responses in mice similar to those induced naturally in POWV-infected individuals, and that vaccine-induced immunity provided protection in a POWV challenge animal model. 
`` The significant protection in mice demonstrated by our vaccine is highly encouraging and strongly supports the importance of this vaccine approach for further study, '' said Muthumani.

Residents of and visitors in POWV-endemic areas are considered at risk of infection, especially during outdoor work and recreational activities. In the U.S., cases of POWV disease have been reported in Northeastern states and the Great Lakes region. 
`` Given the risk of serious complications from POWV and the 300 % increase in incidence of POWV infection over the past 16 years, we will continue efforts to advance this urgently needed emerging infectious disease vaccine candidate towards the clinic, '' said Weiner.

G8R8N8MYUL,"California: St. Louis encephalitis case reported in Stockton, 1st case in nearly 50 years","By NewsDeskВ В @bactiman63
San Joaquin County Public Health Services received a report of a human case of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) in a person from Stockton. The individual is recovering at home.

This is the first reported human case in San Joaquin County since 1973.
In August 2020, the San Joaquin County Mosquito and Vector Control DistrictвЂ™s mosquito-borne disease surveillance program discovered SLEV in a group of collected mosquitoes in zip code 95240.
The symptoms and transmission of SLEV are similar to that of the West Nile virus (WNV), but SLEV is less common in California than WNV. WNV and SLEV are both in the flavivirus family and transmitted through mosquito bites. In 2020, there has only been one report of WNV in San Joaquin County вЂ“ in an asymptomatic blood donor.
People can get infected with St. Louis encephalitis virus from the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. A mosquito becomes infected with SLEV after biting a bird that is infected with the virus. SLEV is not spread from person to person.
Most people infected with SLEV do not have any symptoms or develop mild symptoms including fever, headache, or nausea, which occur up to two weeks after being bitten. In a small number of people, SLEV can cause swelling or inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) which may lead to death. Older adults are the most likely to get very sick if they are infected.",http://outbreaknewstoday.com/california-st-louis-encephalitis-case-reported-in-stockton-1st-case-in-nearly-50-years-16686/,#,,24/10/2020 15:57,2020-10-24 10:27:32+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,outbreaknewstoday.com,,1603542452,EN
YSJSQMI64G,County Reports Human Case Of St. Louis Encephalitis Virus,"San Joaquin County Public Health Services has received a report of a human case of St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) in the county. This is the first reported human case in San Joaquin County since 1973. The person with SLEV lives in Stockton and is recovering at home. In August 2020, the San Joaquin County Mosquito and Vector Control DistrictвЂ™s mosquito-borne disease surveillance program discovered SLEV in a group of collected mosquitoes in zip code 95240; the Lodi area. This was also the first environmental detection of SLEV in San Joaquin County since 1973. Stanislaus County has also had mosquito collections that tested positive for SLEV this year. (For statewide SLEV data see: http://westnile.ca.gov/sle.php)
The symptoms and transmission of SLEV are similar to that of the West Nile virus (WNV), but SLEV is less common in California than West Nile. WNV and SLEV are both in the flavivirus family and transmitted through mosquito bites. In 2020, there has only been one report of WNV in San Joaquin County, in an asymptomatic blood donor. People can get infected with St. Louis encephalitis virus from the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. A mosquito becomes infected with SLEV after biting a bird that is infected with the virus. SLEV is not spread from person to person. Most people infected with SLEV do not have any symptoms or develop mild symptoms including fever, headache, or nausea, which occur up to two weeks after being bitten. In a small number of people, SLEV can cause swelling or inflammation of the brain (encephalitis) which may lead to death. Older adults are the most likely to get very sick if they are infected.
To help reduce the risk of getting mosquito-transmitted diseases such as St. Louis encephalitis virus and West Nile virus, follow these recommendations: Eliminate all standing water on your property where mosquitoes can breed. When outdoors, apply insect repellent that contains EPA registered active ingredients including DEET, Picaridin, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or IR3535. Follow the labelвЂ™s instructions.
Avoid spending time outside when mosquitoes are most active, at dawn and dusk, and especially for the first two hours after sunset. If outdoors when mosquitoes are active, wear long pants, loose-fitting/long-sleeved shirts, and other protective clothing. Exclude mosquitoes from your home with tight-fitting screens on doors and windows.

O4VCQT0NQX,вЂ�Understanding the Socio-Ecological Drivers of the Emergence of Lyme Disease in MaineвЂ™ on Zoom,"The blacklegged tick (Ixodes scapularis) first appeared in Maine during the 1980s, and its geographic range expansion has been associated with a concomitant increase in the prevalence of tick-borne pathogens throughout the state. Maine has experienced a five-fold increase in incidence of Lyme disease in humans over the past decade, and multiple emerging tick-borne diseases also are on the rise, including human babesiosis, human granulocytic anaplasmosis and Powassan virus.
This talk at 5 p.m. on Monday, Oct. 19 will explore the ecological and social drivers of the spread of the blacklegged tick and the pathogens it transmits, drawing upon ongoing, collaborative research at the University of Maine, and discuss management strategies to inhibit tick-borne disease transmission among wildlife and humans.
Dr. Allison Gardner is a medical entomologist. Her research focuses on the ecology of infectious diseases of humans and wildlife that are transmitted by arthropod vectors, such as mosquitoes or ticks. Dr. GardnerвЂ™s current projects include studying the invasion of the blacklegged tick and Lyme disease in Maine, investigating the ecology of a mosquito vector for Zika virus in the Caribbean, and understanding the interactions between risk of exposure to vector-borne disease and economic interests (e.g., timber harvesting, tourism) at local and international spatial scales. She completed her Ph.D. in entomology, M.S. in statistics, and M.S. in veterinary pathobiology at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Currently, Dr. Gardner is an assistant professor in the School of Biology and Ecology and a cooperating faculty member in the Ecology and Environmental Sciences program, the Senator George J. Mitchell Center for Sustainability Solutions, the Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center and the Graduate School of Biomedical Science and Engineering at the University of Maine.

F43MUJE28T,Sad summer for West Nile virus in Europe and North America (but good for us),"Where the hell are all the people? by Philip Copitch
The raging COVID-19 pandemic in North America and Europe in March and April 2020 caused people to shelter-in-place, protecting them from mosquito bites. Later, as lockdowns were gradually lifted, and people started getting outside, mosquitoes had plenty of chance to bite people. However, as the entire public health infrastructure was diverted to respond to the COVID-19 response, there was a concern that lack of attention could lead to potential outbreaks of other diseases. In particular, mosquito- and tick-borne diseasesВ  generally receive less attention than directly transmitted pathogens, given that most of these pathogens are not as common. This is a valid concern, already demonstrated in other parts of the world such as a resurgence of dengue and malaria with reduced control and investments.
In North America and Europe, the most important endemic mosquito-borne disease is West Nile virus. West Nile virus was first detected outside of Africa in Europe in the 1960s, and spread more widely in the 1990s and 2000s. It was also introduced into North America through New York in 1999, and quickly spread across the continent, reaching the Pacific coast by 2003. West Nile virus became endemic on both continents, perpetuated locally in a bird-mosquito amplification cycle, spilling over and infecting dead-end hosts such as horses, people, and other mammals. Between 1999 and 2014, 37,000 cases were reported in the United States, 1600 of those involving neurological symptoms, such as meningitis, encephalitis or flaccid paralysis, and causing an estimated economic burden of $778 million in healthcare costs and lost productivity.
There has been large variability in the annual number of reported cases between years both in North America and Europe, partly explained by variation in climate-driven temperature anomalies, viral genetics, as well as ecological factors such as avian host immunity. While there was a hope that case numbers will gradually decline past 2003 in the United States, there was a large outbreak in 2012, when 5,674 cases were reported, 2,873 of which were neuroinvasive, and 286 of those patients died. Similarly, 2018 in Europe proved to be a record year for West Nile virus infections, with 2083 cases and 181 deaths reported, across a large geographic extent of Europe, mainly attributed to ideal climatic conditions such as high temperatures.
Given this large variability in West Nile virus infection rates, and the fact that it has been 8 years since the largest outbreak in North America, it was worrisome this summer that we would get another large West Nile virus outbreak. That would have very difficult, as public health resources have been diverted away from environmental health to COVID-19 response, creating a situation where, potentially, human cases would become the sentinels for WNV transmission between mosquitoes, not the other way around. This was such a concern that a group of mosquito experts at the CDC published a call in the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report for the continuation of mosquito and WNV surveillance amid the pandemic. For example, in Spokane County, where I live, staff members at the Spokane Regional Health District who normally deal with Environmental Health have been tasked with COVID-19 response. In addition, the Washington Department of Health has stopped receiving mosquitoes from surveillance partners, such as myself, to identify and test those mosquitoes for West Nile virus. I actually collected mosquitoes using CDC-light and gravid traps in Spokane County, and am still in the process of learning the molecular methods to test them myself for WNV in my lab. That basically left Spokane County without functional West Nile virus surveillance of mosquitoes this summer, so I wouldnвЂ™t have noticed a large increase in risk to people. Fortunately, the Mosquito Control Districts in our state still kept collecting and testing mosquitoes, and providing data to the State and the CDC.
Human disease cases, reported to CDC ArboNet by county of residence Map made by CDC ArboNet https://wwwn.cdc.gov/arbonet/Maps/ADB_Diseases_Map/index.html
At this point, it seems like that we got lucky, and there hasnвЂ™t been a large outbreak of WNV, neither in North America, nor in Europe. As of October 6, 2020, only 279 cases of West Nile virus disease have been reported in the United States, of which 212 were neuroinvasive; however, cases were spread across the US. There were generally low numbers of WNV detections in horses and mosquitoes as well, although the latter could have been a side effect of limited surveillance.
Comparison of areas reporting human cases in 2020 with previous transmission seasons by ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/images/ECDC_WNF_Affected_current_and_past_seasons_02-10.png)
In Europe, as of October 1, 2020, EU Member States reported 257 cases and 30 deaths, most of them in Greece, Italy and Spain, almost 10 times less cases and deaths than in 2018. In addition, the geographic area where WNV cases were reported were also much smaller than in 2018, except for a few areas in Germany and Spain, from where WNV cases have not yet been reported before.
Why did we get so lucky? IвЂ™m not quite sure. However, one of the factors cited as causing the massive WNV outbreak in the United States was a prolonged drought. This might seem counterintuitive, as mosquito larvae need water to develop in. However, the main vectors of West Nile virus, Culex mosquitoes, need high nutrient levels in their breeding sites, which get concentrated in conditions of drought. In addition, drought conditions concentrate birds and mosquitoes around the last few remaining wet areas, supercharging the amplification cycle. These features lead to both increased Culex abundance and West Nile virus levels during drought conditions. Comparing the drought maps of 2012 and 2020 for the United States, one can see that there was a much more severe and widespread drought in 2012 compared to 2020.В  В So we might have been saved byВ  less heat and more rain!
Of course, the mosquito and West Nile virus season in North America and Europe is not quite over, and there might be additional human cases still reported in the next few weeks. However, itвЂ™s unlikely that this overall trend will change.
We should take our luck with mosquitoes and West Nile virus this summer in our stride, and make sure we build back our mosquito and West Nile virus surveillance capacity that we lost this summer. I will certainly work hard on getting my lab ready to test the mosquitoes I collect in Spokane County next year, and I also hope that the Washington Department of Health will reestablish their capacity to identify and test mosquitoes for West Nile. Ultimately, I do hope that the COVID-19 pandemic will lead our society to appreciate more the importance of disease surveillance and be willing to invest more money in maintaining it.",https://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bugbitten/2020/10/09/sad-summer-for-west-nile-virus-in-europe-and-north-america-but-good-for-us/,"North America, North America, North America, North America, North America, North America, North America, North America, North America",,11/10/2020 12:42,2020-10-09 04:00:58+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,blogs.biomedcentral.com,,1602223258,EN

Human disease cases, reported to CDC ArboNet by county of residence Map made by CDC ArboNet https://wwwn.cdc.gov/arbonet/Maps/ADB_Diseases_Map/index.html
At this point, it seems like that we got lucky, and there hasnвЂ™t been a large outbreak of WNV, neither in North America, nor in Europe. As of October 6, 2020, only 279 cases of West Nile virus disease have been reported in the United States, of which 212 were neuroinvasive; however, cases were spread across the US. There were generally low numbers of WNV detections in horses and mosquitoes as well, although the latter could have been a side effect of limited surveillance.
Comparison of areas reporting human cases in 2020 with previous transmission seasons by ECDC (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/images/ECDC_WNF_Affected_current_and_past_seasons_02-10.png)
In Europe, as of October 1, 2020, EU Member States reported 257 cases and 30 deaths, most of them in Greece, Italy and Spain, almost 10 times less cases and deaths than in 2018. In addition, the geographic area where WNV cases were reported were also much smaller than in 2018, except for a few areas in Germany and Spain, from where WNV cases have not yet been reported before.
Why did we get so lucky? IвЂ™m quite sure. However, one of the factors cited as the massive WNV outbreak in the United States was a prolonged drought. Comparing the drought maps of 2012 and 2020 for the United States, one can see that there was a much more severe and widespread drought in 2012 compared to 2020.В  В So we might have been saved byВ  less heat and more rain!
Of course, the mosquito and West Nile virus season in North America and Europe is not quite over, and there might be additional human cases still reported in the next few weeks. However, itвЂ™s unlikely that this overall trend will change.
We should take our luck with mosquitoes and West Nile virus this summer in our stride, and make sure we build back our mosquito and West Nile virus surveillance capacity that we lost this summer. I will certainly work hard on getting my lab ready to test the mosquitoes I collect in Spokane County next year, and I also hope that the Washington Department of Health will reestablish their capacity to identify and test mosquitoes for West Nile. Ultimately, I do hope that the COVID-19 pandemic will lead our society to appreciate more the importance of disease surveillance and be willing to invest more money in maintaining it.",http://blogs.biomedcentral.com/bugbitten/2020/10/09/sad-summer-for-west-nile-virus-in-europe-and-north-america-but-good-for-us/,"North America, North America, North America, North America, North America, North America, North America, North America",,09/10/2020 10:30,2020-10-09 04:00:58+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,blogs.biomedcentral.com,,1602223258,EN
3VVYXSRFNU,Cat Que Virus incapable of triggering epidemic: ICMR-NIV Director,"Cat Que Virus incapable of triggering epidemic: ICMR-NIV Director 
Ashish Srivastava 
New Delhi, Oct 5 ( IANS ): The Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) published a study a few days ago wherein the world got to know about a virus which was reported in China and Vietnam in the past, and was found in India as well. 
However, the media sensationalised it as another virus from China that could unleash an epidemic, fanning fear among the people who are trying to come to terms with the coronavirus pandemic. 
The scientists of ICMR-National Institute of Virology ( NIV ), Pune, came on record and told IANS that the Cat Que Virus ( CQV ) can not trigger an epidemic. 
The most it could do is cause `` sporadic infections in rural areas ''. They also concluded that CQV could not be perceived as a major public health threat at the present moment. 
`` Our conclusion is that it can cause sporadic infections in rural areas where culicine vectors ( a breed of mosquitoes ) are found to breed. This virus does n't have the capabilities to cause an epidemic or pandemic, '' said DT Mourya, Director of Virology, NIV. 
The CQV is not new to India. Mourya told IANS that scientists had first isolated CQV long back in 1961 in Sagar district in Karnataka. 
`` It belongs to ` Bunyaviridae ', which is one of the largest families of animal viruses. It houses 350 viruses, most of which are arthropod-borne. In the past, many viruses from this family have been isolated and reported from India such as Kaisodi virus, Umbre virus, Oya virus, Chittoor virus, Thottapalayam virus, Kaikalur virus, Thimiri virus, Sathuperi virus, Ganjam virus etc.. Many closely related viruses from this group have been isolated from mosquitos, humans, birds and pigs across a vast geographic region, '' Mourya said. 
Cases of CQV were first reported in 2004 when it was isolated from mosquitoes during surveillance in Vietnam and later in Uganda, scientists informed. 
The study published by ICMR detected CQV antibodies in two out of 883 human serum samples tested against the virus. These samples were collected from various Indian states during 2014 - 2017. 
Both the samples tested returned positive for anti-CQV IgG antibody, indicating that they were infected with the virus at some point. The study showed that Indian mosquito breeds such as Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. Tritaeniorhynchus were susceptible to the virus. Besides, pigs and birds like Jungle Myna may also act as a host to the virus. 
The study also showed that the virus could be transmitted when a person is bitten by a mosquito. This virus is known to cause encephalitis-like symptoms similar to Japanese encephalitis ( JE ). 
`` Cat Que virus is a rare infection and is known to be transmitted by certain culicine mosquito species that are also known to transmit JE virus. The natural cycle of this virus looks similar to JE virus. These viruses can cause acute, self-limiting febrile illness that generally gets clubbed into a viral fever and can be misdiagnosed due to similarity to many existing infections like dengue, chikungunya, malaria etc., '' Mourya explained. 
Considering these isolations from the neighbouring countries -- CQV in Culex mosquitoes in China and pigs of Vietnam -- and assuming the spread of vector mosquitoes in India, ICMR-NIV attempted to develop diagnostic assays for rapid detection of this virus. 
Pragya D Yadav, a scientist at NIV and one of the researchers of the study, said that the research conducted is a part of exploratory studies of the institute and people should perceive it as a major health threat. 
`` The entire work is part of the exploratory research studies conducted by NIV as part of its research activity for developing proactive preparedness for new viruses. At the present moment, the Cat Que virus is not at all perceived as a major public health threat and does not merit enhanced attention, '' said Yadav. 
`` Active infection by CQV has been detected in India. The antibodies have been found in only two persons in the last seven years, and even those two people never developed any symptoms of the disease. It is very less likely that the infection by this particular virus can spread in humans. We need to screen more samples to understand its prevalence. 
`` However, all should take precautions and follow safety measures which include prevention of water collection in plants, water coolers and nearby surroundings, '' said Guduru Narayana Prudhvi Raj, Senior Consultant and General Physician at Apollo Tele.

10O9CWIMFY,West Nile Virus infections found in Tulare County,"West Nile Virus infections found in Tulare County. Here's what you can do to be safe. 
James Ward 

| Visalia Times-Delta 
Mosquitoes are the absolute worst. Here's how to stop them. The summertime pest can spread diseases, like West Nile Virus, encephalitis and Zika. Fortunately, we can keep their numbers down if we work together. Two Tulare County people have confirmed cases of West Nile Virus and three more county residents are suspected of contracting the mosquito-borne disease, the Tulare County Health and Human Services Agency reported on Thursday. Tulare County Public Health Officer Dr. Karen Haught is urging residents to take precautions against mosquito bites, as mosquito samples positive for West Nile Virus have been found in multiple locations within Tulare County. In addition, samples indicate that St. Louis Encephalitis Virus ( SLEV ) may also be present, posing a risk to the public, Haught said. The West Nile Virus is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes, and there is no vaccine or medication to treat the virus, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most people infected with West Nile will have no symptoms; however, about 1 in 5 people will develop a fever with other symptoms from two to 14 days after being infected, the CDC reports. Severe cases of West Nile Virus can affect the central nervous system, resulting in meningitis and/or encephalitis, and can result in death or long-term disability, the CDC reports. The St. Louis Encephalitis Virus ( SLEV ) is in the same virus family as West Nile Virus. Both viruses are transmitted to humans when bitten by an infected mosquito, the CDC reports. Most people infected with SLEV will have few to no symptoms. The most common symptoms are mild, flu-like symptoms, including fever and headache, from five to 15 days after being infected, the CDC reports. Severe cases of SLEV can also affect the central nervous system, resulting in meningitis and/or encephalitis, and can result in death or long-term disability, the CDC reports. Prevention Lookout for homes that are unoccupied or in foreclosure, since many have swimming pools or backyard ponds that are breeding grounds for mosquitoes, Tulare County health officials advise. Contact your local mosquito abatement district if you see areas of standing water that may be a breeding area for mosquitoes. Tulare County has three mosquito abatement districts providing abatement services to residents: Delta Vector Control ( Mosquito Abatement District ) -- Covering the northern portion of Tulare County. Contact the Visalia Office at (559)В 732-8606 or visit online at http://www.deltavcd.com/.Tulare Mosquito Abatement District -- Covering the western portion of Tulare County. Contact the Tulare Office at (559)В 686-6628 or visit online at https://www.tularemosquito.com/.Delano Mosquito Abatement District -- Covering the southern portion of Tulare County. Contact the Delano Office at (661)В 725-3114 or visit online at https://delanomosquito.com/.Animals and West Nile Horses are also particularly susceptible to infection with West Nile Virus, but there is a vaccine for horses to prevent these diseases, and horse owners should have their horses vaccinated annually and keep vaccinations up to date as a preventive measure. Information: http://westnile.ca.gov/.Mosquito bite protection To avoid being bitten by mosquitos and reducing your risk of West Nile Virus and SLEV exposure, Tulare County health officials advise: Use EPA-registered insect repellent such as DEET. Always follow label instructions carefully. Dress in long sleeves and pants during dawn and dusk or in areas where mosquitoes are active. Drain standing water that may produce mosquitoes. Repair or replace door and window screens that have tears or holes. James Ward covers entertainment, news, sports and lifestyles for the Visalia Times-Delta/Tulare Advance-Register.

K62QTW2MF3,What is Cat Que virus?,"What is Cat Que virus? 
By: Explained Desk | New Delhi | 

Updated: October 1, 2020 7:58:20 am 

The presence of the Cat Que virus has been largely reported in Culex mosquitoes in China. In a study published in July in the Indian Journal of Medical Research, scientists from the Pune-based Maximum Containment Laboratory and ICMR-National Institute of Virology have noted the presence of antibodies against the Cat Que virus ( CQV ) in two human serum samples. 
What does the study say? 
The presence of the Cat Que virus has been largely reported in Culex mosquitoes in China and in pigs in Vietnam. For the study, 1020 human serum samples that showed acute febrile illness during 2014 - 2017 were collected. All these samples, however, were found to be negative for CQV when subjected to the real-time RT-PCR test. Of these samples, the majority ( 806 ) were collected from Karnataka, followed by Maharashtra ( 116 ), Kerala ( 51 ), Madhya Pradesh ( 20 ) and Gujarat ( 27 ). 
However, antibody positivity was recorded in two of the 883 samples that were tested for the presence of antibodies. These two samples were taken from Karnataka in 2014 and 2017. Significantly, the study notes that a virus was isolated from a jungle myna serum sample in Sagar district of Karanataka in 1961. This virus was characterised as CQV in 2016 using next-generation sequencing technology. 
Why was this study undertaken? 
The study, which was conducted in 2017 - 2018, was undertaken to develop diagnostic tests for CQV prompted by the spread of similar species of Culex mosquitoes in India.

What is the Cat Que virus? 
For CQV, domestic pigs are considered to be the primary mammalian hosts. Antibodies against the virus have been reported in swine reared locally in China, which indicates that the virus has formed a `` natural cycle '' in the local area and has the ability to spread in pigs and other animal populations through mosquitoes. 
A paper published in the journal Vector Borne and Zoonotic Diseases in 2015 says that CQV belongs to the Simbu serogroup and infects both humans and economically important livestock species. It was first isolated in 2004 from mosquitoes during the surveillance of arbovirus activity in northern Vietnam. In this study, researchers reported a CQV strain ( SC0806 ), which was isolated from mosquito samples collected in China in 2006 and 2008. 
How can humans get infected and is there a cause for concern? 
Humans can get infected through mosquitoes as well. In the study, scientists note that because of positivity in human serum samples and the replication capability of CQV in mosquitoes, there is only a `` possible disease-causing potential '' of CQV in the Indian scenario. Further, `` Availability of vector, primary mammalian host ( swine ) and confirmation of CQV from jungle myna signifies the potential of this Orthobunyavirus as a public health pathogen in India, '' the study says '' ( CQV belongs to the genus Orthobunyavirus ). 
So, is this virus dangerous? 
It is not clear. Other viruses that belong to the same genus as CQV and are similarly transmitted through mosquitoes include the Cache valley virus that can cause meningitis, the La Crosse virus that can cause paediatric encephalitis, the Jamestown Canyon virus that causes Jamestown Canyon encephalitis and the Guaroa virus that causes febrile illness.

Pune, September 28: At the time when the world is battling with coronavirus, another virus from China called ` Cat Que Virus ' ( CQV ) reportedly has the potential to cause disease. ` Cat Que Virus ' was discovered by scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ). The virus falls under the category of Arthropod-borne viruses. It is found in pigs and culex mosquitoes, reported Hindustan Times. 
According to the report, Scientists at the National Institute of Virology ( NIV ), ICMR, Pune discovered antibodies for the virus. The antibodies were detected in two out of the 883 human serum sample tested at the laboratory. These two samples were detected from Karnataka. 
The two people were found to be positive for the presence of anti-CQV IgG antibodies in 2014 and 2017, reported the media house. According to ICMR scientists, availability of vector, primary mammalian host ( swine ) and confirmation of CQV from the jungle myna bird points to the presence of orthobunyavirus in the country. 
What is Cat Que Virus: 
According to US National Library of Medicine, Cat Que virus ( CQV ), a Simbu serogroup virus of the genus Orthobunyavirus ( family Bunyaviridae ), was first isolated in 2004 from mosquitoes during surveillance of arbovirus activity in acute pediatric encephalitis in northern Vietnam. The complete genome sequence of SC0806 isolated from mosquitoes ( Culex tritaeniorhynchus ) was found in Sichuan Province, China. 
`` Anti-CQV IgG antibody positivity in human serum samples tested and the replication capability of CQV in mosquitoes indicated a possible disease-causing potential of CQV in Indian scenario, '' reported Money Control quoting ICMR as saying.

PKATMOYMH9,Tick-borne encephalitis in Denmark: New cases in Tisvilde Hegn and on the island of Falster,"By NewsDeskВ В @bactiman63
In the period from June to mid-August 2020, Statens Serum Institut detected three Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) cases in patients who, with great certainty, were bitten by ticks in Tisvilde Hegn and the surrounding areas, but beyond the area where the natural playground is located. Additionally, a patient has become infected with TBE on the island of Falster.
Denmark/CIA
In 2019, Tisvilde Hegn and the surrounding areas were identified as a new TBE risk area. In the period from September to June 2019, four patients were thus diagnosed with TBE after being bitten with great certainty by TBEV-infected ticks in and around Tisvilde Hegn.
The SSI and the University of Copenhagen detected TBE in ticks from a popular natural playground in the north-eastern part of Tisvilde Hegn in 2019 as well as 2020. The ticks were collected by so-called вЂњflaggingвЂќ, i.e. dragging a piece of cloth across the vegetation.
In June, it was therefore decided to close the natural playground completely and to move it to a TBE-free area.
Following this measure, the period from June to mid-August 2020 brought an additional three cases of TBE in this area. All cases were observed in patients who very likely were bitten by ticks in Tisvilde Hegn and surroundings, beyond the area with the natural playground. The four patients are adults aged 40-76 years:
вЂњThe cases include three persons moving beyond the paths of the area while residing in the area, having stayed in a holiday residence or having stayed in the woods for a brief period of time. All of them have been admitted to hospital with typical TBE symptoms,вЂќ notes Staff Specialist Peter Henrik Andersen from the SSI.
The fourth TBE-infectee is a woman in her 60s from the island of Falster who was bitten by a tick in May, but who does not recall where she was when the bite occurred. She has only visited local woods on the island of Falster and has not been to Tisvilde Hegn or any other areas where TBE ticks have been found.
In Denmark, the island of Bornholm and Tisvilde Hegn and surrounding areas are considered TBE risk areas.
вЂњTBE vaccination should be considered particularly for persons who regularly spend time and who walk beyond established paths in woods and shrubbery, e.g., forestry workers, hunters, orienteers, mushroom and berry pickers and people who regularly engage in play, sports or other activities in the woods,вЂќ explains Peter Henrik Andersen.
The new case recently detected on the island of Falster indicates that TBE is still spreading geographically, in Denmark as well as in the rest of Europe.
вЂќWe must therefore accept that more and more TBE risk areas may appear across Denmark,вЂќ notes Peter Henrik Andersen.

GVLGRJ3GF9,Two Exotic Disease-Carrying Ticks Had Just Been Identified in Rhode Island,"Two Exotic Disease-Carrying Ticks Had Just Been Identified in Rhode Island 
Local authorities in Rhode Island announced that two new tick species were identified on Block Island. The tick species were traced back to Eurasia and Asia origins. 
Dr. Danielle Tufts from Columbia University identified the two species Haemaphysalis longicornis ( Asian long-horned tick ) and Haemaphysalis punctata ( red sheep tick ), reported the state's Department of Environmental Management ( DEM ). 

( Photo: Asian long-horned tick, adult female dorsal view climbing on a blade of grass - Photo by James Gathany; CDC ) 

The Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management ( DEM ) announced Monday that two exotic species of Asian and Eurasian ticks have been detected for the first time on Block Island. Dr. Tufts, who has been researching Block Island for the past ten years, confirmed that the two exotic species had not previously existed in Rhode Island. 
The Asian long-horned tick, commonly found in China, Japan, and the Pacific Islands, was first detected in New Jersey three years ago. The tick is known to carry dangerous diseases such as Lyme disease. The ticks can affect pets, livestock, and people as well. 
Lyme disease is caused by Borellia burgdorferi and B. mayonii. Typically in the United States, black-legged ticks are known to be disease carriers. 
Symptoms of the disease include fever, headache, and erythema migrans ( skin rash ). Severe cases may lead to infection in the heart, joints, and nervous system.

Disease-Carrying Ticks 
The red sheep tick is native to European countries such as the United Kingdom and parts of northern Africa. Not previously identified in North America or other regions outside its native habitats, the tick has been detected on imported animals and animal products. 
H. longicornis has also been an invasive species to Australia and New Zealand, affecting their cattle and other livestock. Now, the tick also poses a new threat to livestock in Rhode Island and surrounding states. 
H. punctata has been observed to adapt to various environments and is typically associated with cows, sheep, and goats in Europe. Both species are known to bite humans less frequently than animals but can transmit diseases. 
The red sheep tick carries diseases such as tick-borne encephalitis virus, Bhanja virus, Tribec virus, and several others. Bhanja virus was the first tick-borne virus discovered in India when Charles Calisher detected the virus in a goat and contracted the illness.

Tick Safety Guidelines 
DEM gave several precautions against tick-borne diseases from both native and exotic species across New England states. Farmers, hunters, and hikers are at higher risk and should be extra cautious. 
Some of the safety guidelines include applying tick repellant on exposed skin. Products with permethrin, an insecticide, can be used on equipment such as shoes and clothing but not directly on the skin. It is also best to wear pants and long sleeves for protection. 
On the occasion that ticks are found on pets or people, they should be removed using tweezers. The affected area should be disinfected after washing with soap and water. Ticks should not be squished since their blood and fluid may contain harmful pathogens. Pets should also be regularly checked for ticks.

Even as India is struggling to contain the coronavirus pandemic, the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) has warned of the danger posed by another virus from China. Called Cat Que Virus ( CQV ), it can cause febrile illnesses, meningitis, and paediatric encephalitis in humans. Also Read - Delhi records 45 malaria and 35 dengue cases: Tips for prevention of vector-borne diseases One of the arthropod-borne viruses, Cat Que Virus has been spotted in culex mosquitoes and pigs across China and Vietnam.

Researchers at the National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) in Pune have found antibodies for CQV in two out of the 883 human serum samples which were taken from various Indian states. This implies that the persons had at some point of time contracted the infection. However, the virus was not found in any of the human or animal samples during the course of the study. Both the samples that were found to be positive for the presence of anti-CQV IgG antibodies came from Karnataka -- one from 2014 and the other from 2017. The findings of the study were published in the latest issue of the Indian Journal of Medical Research ( IJMR ). Presence of CQV antibodies in human serum samples and the replication capability of this virus in mosquitoes indicate a possible disease-causing potential of CQV in the Indian scenario, the ICMR noted. Screening of more human and swine serum samples is required to understand the prevalence of this neglected tropical virus, it added. Some more facts about Cat Que Virus 
Cat Que virus ( CQV ) was first isolated in 2004 from mosquitoes during surveillance of arbovirus activity in acute pediatric encephalitis in northern Vietnam. A complete genome sequence of the virus was isolated from mosquitoes ( Culex tritaeniorhynchus ) in Sichuan Province, China in 2015. Domestic pigs are the primary mammalian host of CQV and antibodies against the virus have been found in pigs reared locally in China, indicating that CQV has formed a natural cycle in local areas. While CQV has been isolated and reported from its natural host, mosquitoes, the role of birds as a host or vector for CQV transmission and report of human infection with CQV are not documented, the ICMR noted. Availability of vector, primary mammalian host ( swine ) and confirmation of CQV from jungle myna signifies the potential of this virus as a public health pathogen in India, cautioned ICMR scientists. Brucellosis outbreak in China 
Scientists have also warned the possibility of another pandemic that can be much more severe than the novel coronavirus. It is the Brucellosis outbreak in China that has scientists worried. This is a contagious bacterial virus that is usually transmitted to humans from farm animals including pigs, cows, and buffaloes. One can get this virus by coming in direct contact with the fluid of an infected animal, eating raw or unpasteurized dairy products or inhaling contaminated air. It is believed that a leak at a biopharmaceutical company in China led to the Brucellosis outbreak. The National Health Commission ( NHC ) of Lanzhou has already confirmed that around 3,245 people in the capital of Gansu province have been diagnosed with Brucellosis. A recent report has also revealed the presence of the disease in India.

C1PTN973T7,Cat que virus from China has potential to cause disease in India: ICMR,"Cat que virus from China has potential to cause disease in India: ICMR 
NEW DELHI: Even as India grapples with the SARS CoV-2 virus causing covid-19, scientists at the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) have found another virus -- cat que virus -- largely reported in China and having the potential to cause disease in the country. 

One of the arthropod-borne viruses ( arboviruses ), CQV can cause febrile illnesses, meningitis and paediatric encephalitis in humans. The presence of cat que virus ( CQV ) in culex mosquitoes and pigs has been reported in China and Vietnam. 
Considering the spread of similar species of culex mosquitoes in India, scientists at National Institute of Virology ( NIV ) ICMR, Pune have found antibodies for the virus in two of the 883 human serum samples tested from across states in India, indicating that the persons had at some point of time contracted the infection. However, the virus was not found in any of the human or animal samples at the time of study. Antibodies are formed by the immune system of humans when a virus attacks the body. 
The two human samples that were found to be positive for the presence of anti-CQV IgG antibodies were from Karnataka in 2014 and 2017 respectively. 
`` Anti-CQV IgG antibody positivity in human serum samples tested and the replication capability of CQV in mosquitoes indicated a possible disease causing potential of CQV in Indian scenario. Screening of more human and swine serum samples using these assays is required as a proactive measure for understanding the prevalence of this neglected tropical virus, '' said the ICMR. The findings of the study have been published in the latest issue of Indian Journal of Medical Research ( IJMR ). 
Availability of vector, primary mammalian host ( swine ) and confirmation of CQV from jungle myna signifies the potential of this orthobunyavirus as a public health pathogen in India, ICMR scientists. This led them to develop molecular and serological tests for CQV, screening of host population ( human and swine ) and its replication kinetics in mosquitoes as part of preparedness against the likely emergence of CQV. 
Scientists did susceptibility and replication kinetics experiment using three different species of mosquitoes to understand its behaviour in Indian mosquitoes. 
`` Data showed that Indian mosquitoes ( Ae. aegypti, Cx. quinquefasciatus and Cx. tritaeniorhynchus ) were susceptible to CQV, '' the ICMR study said. 
According to ICMR, CQV has been isolated and reported from its natural host, mosquito ( culex tritaeniorhynchus ), but the role of birds as a host or vector for CQV transmission and report of human infection with CQV are not documented. Domestic pigs are the primary mammalian host of CQV and antibodies against the virus have been reported in swine reared locally in China, indicating that CQV has formed a natural cycle in local areas.

NY0O449MT9,Covid Cases Spike In Assam But Japanese Encephalitis Falls By 50 Per Cent,"Assam Coronavirus Cases: The number of coronavirus cases in Assam continue to increase.Guwahati: The number of coronavirus cases in Assam continue to increase but there is some good news for the northeastern state's beleaguered health officials - there has been a 50 per cent fall in the number of Japanese Encephalitis (JE) cases.In 2019 the number of JE infections were 630, of which 154 patients died. This year only 318 have been infected so far and 51 have died. The fatality rate has fallen from 24 per cent to 16 per cent.Japanese Encephalitis is a potentially fatal mosquito-borne disease that, in severe cases, can cause inflammation of the brain and leave the patient in a coma or with paralysis.Floods - which Assam has been struggling with for several months now - leave behind pockets of standing water that are perfect breeding grounds for the mosquitoes that carry this disease.The Assam government had also feared the spread of the disease at a time when it is already battling the Covid pandemic; the state has nearly 1.7 lakh confirmed cases so far, of which around 30,000 are active cases and 638 are deaths linked to the virus.Last year, as the death count rose, the state health department initiated an adult vaccination programme for the three worst-affected districts - Goalpara and South Salmara in western Assam and Kokrajhar in the Bodoland Territorial Region.Over nine lakh adults were vaccinated. More than 60 per cent of them were from Goalpara, with around 2.17 lakh from Kokrajhar.В ""Percentage covered in Goalpara was highest with 87.77 per cent of the targeted population vaccinated. Kokrajhar achieved 46.27 per cent and South Salmara 29.5 per cent. Vaccination in Kokrajhar and South Salmara was affected by COVID-19 and had to be stopped,"" a statement from the National Vector Borne Diseases Control Programme, which assisted the state, said.The Assam government is also working to collect data from people between 15 and 65 years of age for the next phase of vaccinations - in five districts plus Kokrajhar and South Salmara, where the original phases were suspended due to the coronavirus threat.",https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/covid-cases-spike-in-assam-but-japanese-encephalitis-falls-by-50-per-cent-2301878,South Salmara,,28/09/2020 13:46,2020-09-27 16:36:03+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,www.ndtv.com,,1601231763,EN

We know that viruses have passed from animals to humans throughout history, and will continue to do so.

ZIU8PIU6DH,Ukraine: Tick-borne encephalitis case reported in Volyn,"By NewsDeskВ В @infectiousdiseasenews
Health officials in Ukraine are reporting a tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) case in a 39-year-old woman from Volyn Oblast in the northwestern part of the country.
Image/CIA
In early August, the woman was bitten by a tick after a walk in the woods, which she removed on her own. In a few weeks she developed dizziness, headache, diarrhea.В The body temperature rose to 38 В° C.
The next day, the woman sought medical help and was hospitalized in the infectious department. According to the results of laboratory testing, a positive result was obtained for tick-borne viral encephalitis.
TBE is an illness caused by a virus spread through the bite of an Ixodes tick.
Symptoms include fever, achiness, loss of appetite, headache, nausea, and vomiting. Swelling of the brain and/or spinal cord, confusion, and sensory disturbances occur in 20-30% of people with TBE. One percent of people die from this infection.
TBE is found in many parts of Europe and Asia (from eastern France to northern Japan and from northern Russia to Albania). Several thousand cases are reported each year, but there are probably many other cases that do not get reported. The highest number of cases occurs in Russia.

TQD9RNAWRW,The management of zoonoses in Kashmir,"Zoonoses are infectious diseases (virus, bacteria and parasites) that can be spread from animals to humans, and vice versa. Zoonoses can spread from direct contact with animals or indirectly. They can be vector-borne or food-borne. Zoonotic diseases are very common, for example, tick-borne encephalitis and borreliosis. Many food-borne infectious diseases like salmonella, Yersinia, botulism or campylobacter are also zoonoses.
In the past 20 years, 70% of the emerging diseases have been found to be zoonotic in nature and about 300 diseases are common to man and animals. Bubonic plague (Black Death), typhoid, malaria, gastrointestinal and sexually transmitted diseases have caused havoc in modern times and interestingly all have animal origins. In recent times, AIDS/HIV, mad cow disease and bird flu have caused major health epidemics.
The problem of zoonoses is compounded on account of poor healthcare infrastructure in the state of J&K. Zoonoses affect humans in a variety of ways. The diseases cause illness or deaths but also monetary losses in the form of cost of drugs and physicianвЂ™s fees, loss of wages, and reduced work efficiency, medico-legal complications, and public scare. In animals, the major impact relates to loss of production and loss of breeding efficiency.
In Kashmir, we can boast of the best tertiary healthcare system but our primary health services are rudimentary, lack infrastructure and equipment. The technical network with respect to disease surveillance is limited and statistical measures are not evolved enough in disease surveillance programmes. Recently the state of J&K has been hooked to the National Disease Surveillance Network, which envisages interconnectivity between different tiers of the network for instant data collection, interpretation, and timely remedial measures.
Factors affecting the probability of zoonotic occurrence include: duration of illness, virulence of the pathogen, stability of the agent in a given environment, density of animal and human population in a locality, animal husbandry & agricultural practices, presence of vectors and rodents, technological and economic diversification, urbanisation and mobility of humans, livestock and livestock products, inadequacy of diagnosis and other health services, genetic component of pathogens and route of transmission of the diseases.
Economic development (dams, roads and deforestation) and rapid social development have also provided opportunities to zoonotic pathogens to emerge and spread rapidly in the human as well as animal populations. Moreover, indiscriminate use of antibiotics, insecticides and other chemicals has led to an alteration in the existing microbial ecology. Greenhouse effect may change the density pattern of the microbes and vectors of the transmissible diseases. Increased densities of ticks and other insects facilitate rapid spread of arthropod-borne infection. Higher rodent populations have enhanced the prevalence of leptospirosis and salmonellosis.
To assess the ability for combating infectious/zoonotic diseases in human beings, it must be kept in the mind that most of the diseases are fundamentally diseases of vertebrate and invertebrate wildlife. Awareness of veterinary knowledge has gradually led to the concept of вЂњone medicineвЂќ wherein experiences of physicians, veterinarians and other medically-oriented scientists are shared. Rudolf Virchow, the father of modern pathology, said that вЂњbetween animal and human medicine there is no dividing line nor should there be. The object is different but the experience obtained constitutes the basis of all medicine.вЂќ So, advanced veterinary expertise and control strategies are important in containing zoonotic infections.
Apart from the allopathic system of medicine, alternate systems of medicine are also exploited in infectious disease control. Communication and information technologies and other traditional media have been effectively used to bring about behavioural changes with respect to communicable diseases like HIV and sexually transmitted diseases. Therefore, management of zoonotic diseases in a well-organised surveillance system is an essential component of disease control and diagnosis of zoonotic diseases in animals and men. Different forums are associated with the issue of combating infectious diseases at international level. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) are the main global organisations concerned with control of infectious diseases.

122G15SBMN,"The mosquito-borne virus flares up in Michigan, health official warns","Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE) is a vector-borne viral disease caused due to the bite of the mosquitoes. Though a rare one, it is one of the dangerous mosquito-borne diseases that causes encephalitis in humans. Horses are susceptible to EEEV infection, and many cases are fatal. Transmission of the virus from horse to human is rare as the horse are the dead-end-hosts. The people who are below 15 and above 50 years are at greatest risk for the disease.

According to the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS), it causes a 33% fatality rate in the US. Recently in the year 2020, they confirmed 22 horses which suffered from EEEV in about 10 countries and a human case from Barry diagnosed with the virus. As the virus is in the near vicinity, the officials urged the people of Bounty, Clare, Ionia, Isabella, Jackson, Kent, Mecosta, Montcalm, Newaygo, and Oakland counties to postpone or cancel any picnic events that happens usually at the dark.
In 2019 in Michigan, six people died, and four of them had taken treatment in the hospital. And most importantly, many people after treatment developed severe neurological symptoms in later life. So people should take care of them and their children and must take the necessary step to prevent the bite of the mosquitoes. 
The MDHHS said that they would start aerial treatment in the area where there is the utmost risk of the EEE. Other counties will receive the treatment shortly, depending on the weather conditions. People should cooperate with the health official efficiently to get off the infection in the area.

815XVTZP6B,Mosquito-borne Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus: What to know,"Mosquito-borne Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus: What to know 
Cases of the rare mosquito-borne virus Eastern Equine Encephalitis, known as EEE, are popping up in Michigan and other U.S. states. What is Eastern equine encephalitis ( EEE )? EEE is a rare disease that is caused by a virus spread by infected mosquitoes. EEE virus ( EEEV ) is one of a group of mosquito-transmitted viruses that can cause inflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ). In the United States, approximately 5-10 EEE cases are reported annually. Between 2010 and 2019, Michigan reported 17 cases of EEE, second-most in the U.S., behind Massachusetts. In 2019, the U.S. confirmed the most cases of EEE in a single-year, with 38 human cases.EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States, with a 33 percent fatality rate in people who become ill and a 90 percent fatality rate in horses that become ill. Here some answers to frequently asked questions on EEE from the Centers for Disease Control: How do people get infected with EEEV?EEEV is transmitted through the bite of an infected mosquito. Disease transmission does not occur directly from person to person. Where and when have most cases of EEE occurred? Most cases of EEE have been reported from Atlantic and Gulf Coast states. Cases have also been reported from the Great Lakes region. EEE cases occur primarily from late spring through early fall, but in subtropical endemic areas ( e.g., the Gulf States ), rare cases can occur in winter. Who is at risk for infection with EEEV? Anyone in an area where the virus is circulating can get infected with EEEV. The risk is highest for people who live, work, or participate in outdoor activities in or around wooded swampy areas in the eastern United States. Persons younger than age 15 and over age 50 are at greatest risk of severe disease following infection. How soon do people get sick after getting bitten by an infected mosquito? It takes 4 to 10 days after the bite of an infected mosquito to develop symptoms of EEE. What are the symptoms of EEEV disease? Most people who become infected with EEEV show either no or mild symptoms such as fever and joint or muscle pain. Severe cases of EEEV infection include encephalitis ( swelling of the brain ) or meningitis ( swelling of the membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord ) and begin with the sudden onset of fever, chills, headache, and vomiting. The illness may then progress into disorientation, seizures, and coma. Approximately a third of patients who develop encephalitis due to EEEV infection die, and many of those who survive have mild to severe brain damage. How is EEE diagnosed? Diagnosis is based on tests of blood or spinal fluid. These tests typically look for antibodies that the body makes against the viral infection. What is the treatment for EEE? There is no specific treatment for EEE. Antibiotics are not effective against viruses, and no effective anti-viral drugs have been discovered. Severe illnesses are treated by supportive therapy which may include hospitalization, respiratory support, IV fluids, and prevention of other infections. How can people reduce the chance of getting infected with EEEV? Prevent mosquito bites. There is no approved vaccine for people or preventive drug. Use insect repellent containing DEET, picaridin, IR3535 or oil of lemon eucalyptus on exposed skin and/or clothing. The repellent/insecticide permethrin can be used on clothing to protect through several washes. Always follow the directions on the package. Wear long sleeves and pants when weather permits. Have secure, intact screens on windows and doors to keep mosquitoes out. Eliminate mosquito breeding sites by emptying standing water from flower pots, buckets, barrels, and other containers. Drill holes in tire swings so water drains out. Keep children's wading pools empty and on their sides when they are n't being used. What should I do if I think a family member might have EEE? Consult your healthcare provider for proper diagnosis. Where did EEE come from? According to Vector Disease Control International, eastern equine encephalitis virus ( EEEV ) is a zoonotic alphavirus and arbovirus, and was first recognized in horses in 1831 in Massachusetts. The first confirmed human cases were identified in New England in 1938. How is EEE transmitted? Eastern equine encephalitis virus ( EEEV ) is maintained in a cycle between Culiseta melanura mosquitoes and avian hosts in freshwater hardwood swamps. Cs. melanura is not considered to be an important vector of EEEV to humans because it feeds almost exclusively on birds. Transmission to humans requires mosquito species capable of creating a `` bridge '' between infected birds and uninfected mammals such as some Aedes, Coquillettidia, and Culex species. Horses are susceptible to EEEV infection and many cases are fatal. EEEV infections in horses, however, are not a significant risk factor for human infection because horses ( like humans ) are considered to be `` dead-end '' hosts for the virus ( i.e., the concentration of virus in their bloodstreams is usually insufficient to infect mosquitoes ). There is a vaccine to prevent EEEV infection in horses. Eastern equine encephalitis virus ( EEEV ) transmission. ( CDC ) Copyright 2020 by WDIV Click.

EEGNKNFRUY,Holtsville mosquito sample among 16 in Suffolk to test positive for West Nile virus,"Holtsville mosquito sample among 16 in Suffolk to test positive for West Nile virus 
HOLTSVILLE, NY ( On. 
Sachem.com / On. 
TownMedia.com ) -- Another mosquito sample from Holtsville has tested positive for West Nile virus. The sample was among six positives from the most - recently announced tests for the virus from across Suffolk County, health officials announced late Monday afternoon. Suffolk County Health Commissioner Dr. Gregson Pigott announced the six mosquito samples to test positive were collected on Sept. 1 from Holtsville, Northport, Port Jefferson Station, Setauket, Stony Brook, and West Babylon. `` The confirmation of West Nile virus in mosquito samples indicates the presence of West Nile virus in the area, '' said Pigott. `` While there is no cause for undue concern, we advise residents to cooperate with us in our efforts to reduce exposure to West Nile virus and other mosquito-borne diseases. '' West Nile virus across Sachem. 
In the Sachem area before today's announcement, the most - recent samples to test positive came from Farmingville and Holtsville during sample testing from Aug. 25 to 27. The first positive within Sachem came from a Holtsville sample collected in mid-July. That was followed by another sample in neighboring North Patchogue, just outside Sachem, during the following week, and more positives from Farmingville on Aug. 6. and Aug. 19 and 20. West Nile virus across Suffolk County. 
To date this season, 82 mosquito samples and four birds have tested positive for West Nile virus. Prior to today's announcement of six positives, there 16 positives reported -- the most at one one time so far this year -- on Sept. 4 from collections taken Aug. 25 to 27. Fourteen positives reported on Aug. 27 from collections on Aug. 19 and 20 in Bay Shore, Brentwood, Cold Spring Harbor, Farmingville, Islip, Lindenhurst, Northport, Rocky Point, Stony Brook, and West Babylon. Nine positives were announced on Aug. 21 from collections on Aug. 11 and 12 in Bay Shore, Cold Spring Harbor, Copiague, Greenlawn, Northport, West Babylon, and West Islip. Fourteen positives were announced on Aug. 13 from collections on Aug. 6 from Bay Shore, Bohemia, Brentwood, Cold Spring Harbor, Copiague, Farmingville, Northport, and West Islip. On Aug. 6, five positive samples were announced from samples collected on July 28 in Bay Shore, Brentwood, Greenlawn, and Northport. Fifteen positive samples were reported on July 30 from collections on July 21 and 22. Those positives came from Bay Shore, Brentwood, Great River, Huntington Station, Islip, North Patchogue, Stony Brook, and West Babylon. On July 24, Pigott said two samples tested positive from samples collection on July 14 and 15 in Bay Shore and Holtsville. Those positives followed the county's July 16 announcement of the season's first positive sample, which came from a July 9 collection in Bay Shore. Health impacts of West Nile virus. 
There has not yet been a human case this year in Suffolk County. The county reported two human cases in September 2019. In those cases, one person developed symptoms and was hospitalized for several days before being discharged. The second individual was hospitalized with West Nile encephalitis and was also discharged. West Nile virus was first detected in birds and mosquito samples in Suffolk County in 1999 and again each year thereafter. The virus is transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected mosquito. Most people infected with West Nile virus will experience mild or no symptoms, but some can develop severe symptoms including high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness and paralysis, according to the health department.

0FUYXFW8F6,Aerial Treatment To Combat Deadly Mosquito-Borne Disease In Oakland County Planned For Sept. 16,"OAKLAND COUNTY, Mich. (CBS DETROIT) вЂ“ In an effort to prevent spread of Eastern Equine Encephalitis (EEE), the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services has announced plans to conduct aerial mosquito control treatment in certain high-risk areas of Michigan.
Treatment is scheduled to occur starting the evening of Wednesday, Sept. 16. However, treatment can only take place under certain weather conditions, so the schedule may need to change.
EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the United States, with a 33 percent fatality rate in people who become ill. People can be infected with EEE from one bite of a mosquito carrying the virus. Persons younger than age 15 and over age 50 are at greatest risk of severe disease following infection. More than 25 percent of the nationвЂ™s EEE cases last year were diagnosed in Michigan.
Signs of EEE infection include the sudden onset of fever, chills, body and joint aches which can progress to a severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures and paralysis. Anyone who thinks they may be experiencing these symptoms should contact a medical provider. Permanent brain damage, coma and death may also occur in some cases.
Aerial treatment is conducted by specialized aircraft, beginning in the early evening and continuing up until the following dawn. State-certified mosquito control professionals will apply an approved pesticide as an ultra-low volume (ULV) spray. ULV sprayers dispense very fine aerosol droplets that stay suspended in the air and kill adult mosquitoes on contact. This is a method many other states have also used to combat EEE. Aerial treatment is provided by Clarke from St. Charles, Ill., which provides mosquito control to protect public health. Clarke pioneers, develops and delivers environmentally responsible products and services to help prevent vector-borne disease, control nuisance and create healthy water bodies.
Treatment is scheduled for the 10 impacted counties: Barry, Clare, Ionia, Isabella, Jackson, Kent, Mecosta, Montcalm, Newaygo and Oakland. Additional areas may be selected for treatment if new human or animal cases occur outside of the currently identified zones.
Residents are encouraged to visitВ Michigan.gov/EEEВ for up-to-date information.

GAVBDPEXV3,Michigan reports 10 Eastern Equine Encephalitis cases in horses in 3 weeks,"Michigan reports 10 Eastern Equine Encephalitis cases in horses in 3 weeks 
By News. 
Desk @infectiousdiseasenews 
The Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development ( MDARD ) has reported 10 Eastern Equine Encephalitis ( EEE ) cases in horses from four counties -- Montcalm, Clare, Newaygo and Kent counties since the first case was reported in Clare County on Aug. 11. 
Image by Clker-Free-Vector-Images from Pixabay 
EEE is a zoonotic, viral disease, transmitted by mosquitoes to both animals and people. EEE is one of the most dangerous mosquito-borne diseases in the U.S., and the virus is typically seen in late summer to early fall each year in Michigan. 
While horses are highly affected by the disease, people can also be infected with EEE from the bite of a mosquito carrying the virus. In humans, signs of EEE include the sudden onset of fever, chills, and body and joint aches. EEE infection can develop into severe encephalitis, resulting in headache, disorientation, tremors, seizures, and paralysis. Permanent brain damage, coma, and death may also occur in some cases. 
In 2019, Michigan reported 10 human EEE cases, with six cases being fatal. 
MDARD says to protect your horses and other domestic animals ( such as dogs, sheep, and goats ), measures could include the following: 

Talking to a veterinarian about vaccinating horses against EEE. 
Placing livestock in a barn under fans ( as mosquitos are not strong flyers ) during peak mosquito activity from dusk to dawn. 
Using an insect repellant on an animal that is approved for the species. 
Eliminating standing water on the property -- i.e., fill in puddles, repair eaves, and change the water in buckets and bowls at least once a day. 
Contacting a veterinarian if an animal shows signs of the illness: fever and stumbling, which can progress to being down and struggling to stand. 

To protect yourself and your family, here's what you should do now: 

Apply insect repellents that contain the active ingredient DEET, or other U.S. Environmental Protection Agency-approved products, to exposed skin or clothing and always follow the manufacturer's directions for use. 
Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants when outdoors. Apply insect repellent to clothing to help prevent bites. 
Maintain window and door screening to help keep mosquitoes outside. 
Empty water from mosquito breeding sites around the home, such as buckets, unused children's pools, old tires, or similar sites where mosquitoes may lay eggs. 
Use nets and/or fans over outdoor eating areas.

LAG685BX43,"National Round-Up: Four infected with a rare tick-borne virus, SSI warns","National Round-Up: Four infected with a rare tick-borne virus, SSI warns 
Four people in Denmark have been infected with TBE ( Tick Borne Encephalitis ) over the summer, according to Statens Serum Institut. 
The area of Denmark most commonly associated with TBE is Bornholm, but there have been no cases stemming from the island so far this summer. 

Instead, the institute believe three were infected in Tisvilde Hegn in North Zealand and one in Falster -- clear signs the virus is spreading across Denmark. 
Vaccine available 
The infected people are aged 40 to 76 years and all have been hospitalised. 
Some patients can suffer permanent mental or neurological damage, according to SSI. 
Accordingly the institution encourages vaccination against the disease for those who regularly move away from paths through the woods, such as forest workers, hunters, orienteering runners, and mushroom and berry pickers. 

Foreign food suspected as cause of outbreaks 
A total of 48 people in Denmark have become sick as a result of imported foods, suspects the Statens Serum Institut. It believes that separate outbreaks of salmonella and hepatitis A virus are the result of holiday-makers returning with food carrying the diseases. The contagious disease hepatitis A tends to cause yellowish skin and hospitalise 80 percent of those who get it. SSI encourages anyone with foreign food to follow the Danish Veterinary and Food Administration's advice on good kitchen hygiene. 
Thieves targeting GPS equipment used by farm machinery 
In August alone, GPS equipment from a total of 23 tractors was stolen, according to the police. The authorities believe the criminals are selling the equipment on the black market. According to the police, the equipment is worth several million kroner. 
Salling Group to launch delivery service 
The supermarket conglomerate Salling Group, the owner of Netto, FГёtex and Bilka, is launching an online platform where over 10,000 grocery items can be delivered to people's homes, reports BГёrsen. Initially vegetables, fish and meat will be available for door-to-door delivery within Greater Copenhagen, expanding to large parts of the country in the long run. As part of the plan, the group expects to hire up to 400 new employees. Its rival Coop already offers an online supermarket service. 
Four Danish men have been arrested in connection with illegal film distribution, according to the Public Prosecutor for Special Economic and International Crime ( SГёik ). The major international case involves authorities from 19 countries, including Denmark. The criminal organisation has allegedly obtained access to movies and series before their release dates.

At the same time, PHE has also recorded a probably case of tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ), which would be the second-ever UK-acquired case. 
The patient with TBE, which is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system, was also hospitalised. 
PHE said patients should contact their GP ` promptly ' if the ` begin to feel unwell ' rembembering to ` tell them you were bitten by a tick or recently spent time outdoors '. 
They stressed that these infections were rare but said people could also be infected by Lyme disease via tick bites. 
Dr Katherine Russell, consultant in the Emerging Infections and Zoonoses team at PHE, said: ` It is important to emphasise that cases of babesiosis and TBE in England are rare and the risk of being infected remains very low. Lyme disease remains the most common tick-borne infection in England. 
` Ticks are most active between spring and autumn, so it is sensible to take some precautions to avoid being bitten when enjoying the outdoors. Seek medical advice if you start to feel unwell after a tick bite. '

4R3AFG09X8,TBE: Rare tick-borne disease that can cause paralysis and meningitis found in UK,"Cases of two rare infections caused by bites from infected ticks - one of which can lead to meningitis, encephalitis and paralysis - have been diagnosed in England, health officials have revealed.The more serious one is a case of tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), a viral infection that affects the central nervous system and can cause a range of serious illnesses, Public Health England (PHE) said.
The other patient has babesiosis, caused by a parasite which infects red blood cells that can lead to flu-like symptoms.Both are very rare in the UK; it is the first time a case of babesiosis acquired in the UK has been recorded and only the second instance of a UK-acquired case of TBE.PHE said in a statement on its website: ""Both patients have been transferred to hospital, where they are receiving appropriate treatment and supportive care.""
Staff have collected and tested ""hundreds"" of ticks from sites in Devon close to where the person with babesiosis lives, PHE said, adding that ""all tested negative for the parasite which causes babesiosis"".
Inspectors have also ""tested deer blood samples from Hampshire in areas near to where the person with probable TBE lives and they have shown evidence of likely TBE virus infection, which matches similar results found in 2019"".
The risk of babesiosis or TBE for the general public is very low.However, a number of infections can develop following a tick bite, including Lyme disease, which remains the most common tick-borne infection in England.PHE said most people with babesiosis ""will have either no symptoms or mild symptoms of infection"".But ""people with weakened immune systems can become very ill and present with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle ache, fatigue, and jaundice"".Similar symptoms are evident in anyone with TBE in the first phase of infection, but the second phase is more serious as it affects the central nervous system and can lead to meningitis, encephalitis and paralysis.Two-thirds of sufferers will have no symptoms.",https://news.sky.com/story/tbe-rare-tick-borne-disease-that-can-cause-paralysis-and-meningitis-found-in-uk-12039910,#,,09/12/2020 11:44,2020-07-31 05:00:00+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,news.sky.com,,1596178800,EN
CNZ50ZLR93,UK records first case of rare tick-borne disease,"UK records first case of rare tick-borne disease 
One person is in hospital after being diagnosed with babesiosis, the UK's first case of the rare tick-borne disease.A second person has been taken to hospital with a probable case of tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ), the second time the disease has been found in the UK, according to Public Health England. Babesiosis is caused by a parasite that infects red blood cells, while TBE is a viral infection that affects the central nervous system. Officials said cases of the infections were rare and the risk of being infected remained low.PHE said both patients had been transferred to hospital, where they were receiving treatment and were expected to make a full recovery. Most people with babesiosis will have either no symptoms or mild symptoms of infection, but people with weakened immune systems can become very ill and present with flu-like symptoms such as fever, chills, muscle ache, fatigue and jaundice. About two-thirds of people with TBE infections will have no symptoms, and, for those who develop symptoms, there are often two phases. The first is associated with flu-like symptoms, such as fever, headache and fatigue, which can then progress to a more serious second phase that involves the central nervous system, which can lead to meningitis, encephalitis and paralysis. This year, PHE has surveyed sites in Devon close to where the person with babesiosis lives, collecting and testing hundreds of ticks, and all tested negative for the parasite that causes babesiosis.PHE also tested deer blood samples from Hampshire in areas near where the person with probable TBE lives and they have shown evidence of likely TBE virus infection, which matches similar results found in 2019. The risk of babesiosis or TBE for the general public is low, but a number of infections can develop following a tick bite, including Lyme disease, and there are measures people can take to reduce the risk of being bitten by ticks.PHE said it was important to `` be tick-aware '' and take precautions such as keeping to footpaths and avoiding long grass, wearing appropriate clothing, considering the use of repellents containing Deet, and making it a habit to carry out a `` tick check ''. If you have been bitten by a tick, it should be removed as soon as possible using fine-tipped tweezers or a tick removal tool. Dr Katherine Russell, consultant in the emerging infections and zoonoses team at PHE, said: `` It is important to emphasise that cases of babesiosis and TBE in England are rare and the risk of being infected remains very low. `` Lyme disease remains the most common tick-borne infection in England.

K6YMST6PNL,Symptoms may be mistaken for COVID-19; hospitalizations are common,"Symptoms may be mistaken for COVID-19; hospitalizations are common 
Researchers have confirmed that Heartland virus, an emerging pathogen with potentially dire consequences for those infected, is present in Lone Star ticks in two Illinois counties hundreds of miles apart. Lone Star ticks were first detected in Illinois in 1999, but had not been found to be infected with Heartland virus in the state. 

The findings are reported in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases. 
In July 2018, a resident of Kankakee County was hospitalized after suffering several tick bites while camping on private property. Two months later and more than 250 miles to the south, a resident of Williamson County was hospitalized with many of the same symptoms: fever, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, decreased appetite and nausea. This patient also noticed tick bites after camping. The Centers for Diseases Control and Prevention confirmed that clinical samples from both patients tested positive for Heartland virus, which is spread by ticks. Both patients eventually recovered. 
Tick-borne illnesses share symptoms with many other diseases and misdiagnoses sometimes occur, said Holly Tuten, a vector ecologist with the Illinois Natural History Survey who led the new research. INHS is a division of the Prairie Research Institute at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
`` Heartland virus wo n't show up on a standard diagnostic panel for tick-borne bacterial diseases, '' she said. `` And with COVID-19 on the collective mind, a tick-borne viral infection could be overlooked, especially in cases where a tick bite was missed. '' 
According to the CDC, there are no vaccines to prevent infection with the Heartland virus or medications to treat it. Most people infected with the virus end up hospitalized and a few have died. 
To determine the source of the viral infections, health department officials in each county interviewed the patients to learn where they were when they were bit. This information allowed Tuten and her team to determine whether ticks in those areas carried the virus. 
Previous research showed that the Lone Star tick, Amblyomma americanum, can carry and transmit the Heartland virus, so the researchers focused their efforts on collecting this species. 
`` Lone Star ticks are very aggressive ambush predators and many people do n't realize this, '' Tuten said. `` I 've seen Lone Star ticks run across a forest floor to me. '' 
The site in Kankakee County was a rural homestead with barnyard animals and a small amount of forest surrounded by cropland, Tuten said. The patient in Williamson County may have been exposed in a heavily wooded wildlife refuge or outside a suburban home with a few trees. 
The researchers collected ticks in all three locales. They shipped their tick samples to the CDC Arboviral Diseases Branch in Fort Collins, Colorado, where the ticks were combined in batches of 10-30 for testing. 
`` A single batch of male Lone Star ticks from each county was found to be positive for the Heartland virus, '' Tuten said. `` Infected Lone Star ticks had been found as far north as Missouri, so we expected to find the infections in ticks from Williamson County in the southern part of Illinois. But finding so many Lone Star ticks in Kankakee County, including some with the virus, really surprised us. '' 
The detection of Heartland virus in adult Lone Star ticks a year after human infection suggests that the infected ticks may have overwintered in the area, Tuten said. 
`` We want to alert physicians and public health officials throughout Illinois that there is a fairly new pathogen out there that is a danger to public health, '' she said. `` I do n't want people to avoid the woods and parks. I just want them to be aware, so they can take concrete steps to reduce tick encounters and bites. '' 
This investigation was a collaboration between the INHS Medical Entomology Laboratory, the Illinois Department of Public Health, the CDC, conservation officials and Illinois residents.",https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/07/200723115835.htm,#,,21/09/2020 02:16,2020-07-23 05:00:00+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,www.sciencedaily.com,,1595487600,EN

With a worldwide pandemic to worry about, people might be excused for forgetting about mosquito - and tick-borne illnesses. But there's bad news: They 're still a concern. Westbrook's Public Health Department, as in previous years, has hired Madison-based Innovative Mosquito Management, Inc., to abate the town's mosquito population. The company's owner, Kurt Ehrhart, is `` extremely knowledgeable and probably the top of his field, '' said Westbrook Director Health Zachary Faiella, noting that several other municipalities in the state also contract with the company to manage mosquitoes. The company identifies mosquito breeding areas, such as `` marshes, ponds -- any standing water that they observe during inspection, including storm drains, which hold standing water at the bottom, '' Faiella explained. It then treats those areas with a larvicide and provides the town with a report of the location, amount of standing water, the number of larvae observed, and the amount of larvicide applied. `` The larvicide they use is used across the United States, '' said Faiella. `` There's no toxicity to humans or the environment other than [ mosquitoes that are ] specifically targeted. It wo n't harm people, pets, or other insects, including honey bees. It's approved in organic farming operations. `` We have to be careful what we put in our environment as we are right next to the Sound and we do n't want anything to have a negative impact on our water quality, '' he continued. The treatments `` wo n't eliminate all mosquitoes in Westbrook, but they will reduce mosquito larvae, which will in turn, will prevent adult mosquitoes from growing and reduces the risk of people being bitten and contracting viruses, '' he said. Statewide Efforts. 
The Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station ( CAES ) this year expanded the number of its mosquito trapping and testing sites from 92 to 108. The 16 new locations are all in eastern Connecticut, considered a high-risk zone for equine encephalitis ( EEE ), although only four cases were reported in the state last year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ). The CAES sites also test mosquitoes for West Nile virus. And there is a third mosquito-borne disease CAES is testing for: Jamestown Canyon virus, although reported throughout the United States, has been largely prevalent in the northern Midwestern states of Minnesota and Wisconsin and rare elsewhere. From 2009 to 2018, only one Connecticut case was reported to the CDC. This summer, however, CAES has discovered five mosquitoes with Jamestown Canyon virus to date and it is the only disease discovered among trapped mosquitoes thus far in 2020. Those mosquitoes were trapped in North Stonington, Waterford, and Westport. Common symptoms of Jamestown Canyon virus are fever, headache and fatigue; it `` can rarely cause severe disease, including infection of the brain ( encephalitis ) or the lining around the brain ( meningitis ), '' according to the CDC. There are no vaccines for any of these diseases; the only prevention is avoiding mosquito bites. `` Westbrook is lucky to have a testing station in town here, '' said Faiella. The Westbrook site pre-existed CAES's expansion. Last year, mosquitoes trapped and tested by CAES in Westbrook were negative for all viruses tested for by CAES, according to Faiella. However, earlier this month, Massachusetts health officials detected EEE in a mosquito sample from a town there and Faiella believes it is only a matter of time before EEE is detected in Connecticut. `` I 'm checking the trapping station information '' on a regular basis in order to monitor the situation, he said. Ticks, Too. 
As for ticks, Lyme disease continues to be the prevalent tick-borne disease in Connecticut and is transmitted only by blacklegged ticks ( commonly known as deer ticks ), which can hard to spot, particularly as the majority of people infected with Lyme contract it from nymphs ( younger ticks ), which can be as small as two millimeters, according to the CDC. In most cases, it takes 36 to 48 hours for the tick to transmit the disease, so it's crucial to remove ticks as soon as possible. In February, the CAES released the results of its first statewide active tick surveillance effort, a federally funded program to track the prevalence of both ticks and tick-borne diseases. More than 2,500 ticks collected from spring to fall 2019 from 40 publicly accessible locations in all eight Connecticut counties were screened for five pathogens that cause the following diseases in humans: anaplasmosis, babesiosis, Lyme disease, hard tick relapsing fever, and Powassan encephalitis. All are caused by blacklegged ( deer ) ticks. In 2019, blacklegged ( deer ) ticks were the most commonly collected, at 2,068, followed by American dog ticks, at 437. While only three lone star ticks and two Asian longhorned ticks were found, both species were determined to be `` emerging '' in Connecticut; the single Asian longhorned tick found in New London County was the first ever found there. Asian longhorned ticks were first reported in the United States in 2017. What Individuals Can Do. 
To avoid mosquito bites, people should use an insect repellent registered with the Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ), Faiella said. Ticks repellents can also be found there. `` You should have it on when you go out, especially between dusk and dawn, '' he said, although it's preferable to avoid going out during those hours, when mosquitoes are most active. Swampy areas and places with standing water are mosquito breeding grounds. Pesticides with the active ingredients of DEET or oil of lemon eucalyptus ( which is not the same as eucalyptus oil ) are most effective against mosquitoes, according to Faiella. `` DEET is the gold standard of insect repellents, '' he said. `` Oil of lemon eucalyptus is the only plant-based active ingredient recommended by the CDC. '' Oil of lemon eucalyptus has been shown to be effective in peer-reviewed studies, he added. The CDC recommends following package directions ( including reapplying when necessary ), never applying pesticides under clothing, and applying sunscreen first with pesticides on top. Permethrin may be used on clothing, gear ( such as tents or mosquito nets ), or shoes, but should not be sprayed directly on skin. Permethrin-sprayed clothing will continue to protect the wearer through several washings, according to the CDC. Faiella recommends `` spraying clothes and wearing long sleeves and long pants when going out hiking or camping. '' At home, anything collecting water should be changed frequently ( bird baths ) or removed ( tires ). `` Cover trash cans, '' said Faiella. `` Change the water in bird baths a couple of times a week. Ensure that your gutters are completely draining and not clogged. `` It's a violation of Connecticut state regulations, specifically 19-13-B1 ... to have stagnant water on a property within 1,000 feet of a residence, '' he said. `` It's officially a public nuisance. We make those complaints a priority, especially right now.

SFTS has caused five deaths and hospitalized 23 people in Jinzhai county of the city of LuвЂ™an since April. 
A disease control staffer from the LuвЂ™an health commission said LuвЂ™an is a mountainous region and villagers working in the fields are often bitten by ticks and leeches. People susceptible to insect bites are more likely to be stricken by insect-borne diseases. 
China: Suspect bubonic plague case reported in Inner Mongolia 
Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome ( SFTS ) is a newly emerging infectious disease. Symptoms and laboratory abnormalities are fever, thrombocytopenia, leukocytopenia, and elevated serum enzyme levels. Multiorgan failure occurs in severe cases, and 6 % -- 30 % of case-patients die. The syndrome is caused by the SFTS virus ( SFTSV ) ( genus Phlebovirus, family Bunyaviridae ). 
Ixodid tick species are implicated as vectors of SFTSV.

The disease is called Severe Fever with Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (SFTS). According to Chinese health officials, the five people who have died due to this disease and the ones who were hospitalised were all from the country's Anhui Province.According to a report published in Global Times, a mouthpiece of the Chinese government, the local health commission of Lu'an, East China's Anhui Province confirmed this on Friday night.The report says SFTS is a ""newly emerging tick-borne disease"". ""It has caused five deaths and hospitalised 23 people in Jinzhai county since April.""The report says earlier there were rumours that these deaths and hospitalisations were due to dengue.""SFTS caused by tick bites is a new epidemic disease of natural origin that has appeared in some parts of China in recent years. The disease induces symptoms such as severe fever, thrombocytopenia, nausea, and vomiting, similar with the symptoms of dengue,"" the report said.""The local authorities confirmed the SFTS caused by tick bites was not dengue fever, which is also spread by the insects,"" Global Times said.However, this is not the first time SFTS has emerged in China.

The Taiwan Department of Disease Control announced this week on the fourth case of Japanese encephalitis this year ( 2020 ) in the country. 
Image/Philippines DOH 
The patient is a 60-year-old male living in Fengshan District, Kaohsiung City. He has no recent travel history. 
The case went to the clinic for fever and neck stiffness on June 13 and went to the clinic again because of symptoms that did not improve. On the 14th, he was re-treated and admitted to the hospital. On the 16th, he changed his consciousness and was admitted to the intensive care unit. 
According to the monitoring data of the CDC, there have been 4 confirmed cases so far this year in the country. The cases live in two cases in Pingtung County, one in Tainan City and one in Kaohsiung City, respectively. 

According to the Department of Disease Control, most people have no obvious symptoms after Japanese encephalitis infection. A few will have headache, fever or aseptic meningitis. In severe cases, there may be changes in consciousness, inability to distinguish people from time to time, general weakness, and brain nerves. Functional impairment, paralysis, etc., even coma or death. The most effective way to prevent Japanese encephalitis is to vaccinate, reminding the public that they should bring their children over 15 months old to the local health clinics or contract hospitals to get the Japanese encephalitis vaccine to avoid serious sequelae caused by infection. People who live in high-risk environments such as pig houses and rice fields near their homes or places of activity. If they feel that they are at risk of infection, they can go to the Travel Medical Clinic to evaluate the vaccination at their own expense. 
The Department of Disease Control reminds that the epidemic of encephalitis in Japan is at its peak. Taiwan uses house mosquitoes, house mosquitoes and white-headed mosquitoes as the main vector mosquitoes. It is often born in rice fields, ponds and irrigation ditches. The peak of blood-sucking is dusk During the dawn period, people are urged to avoid activities in the vicinity of high-risk environments during the peak blood-sucking period of vector mosquitoes; if unavoidable, they should wear light-colored long-sleeved underwear and use government agencies to approve DEDE Or the anti-mosquito agent of Picaridin ingredients to reduce the risk of infection by vector mosquito bites.

Tick-borne diseases are on the rise in the US вЂ“ but programmes to monitor the spread of ticks and the pathogens they carry are underfunded and patchy, according to a survey of professionals working in the area. The findings are вЂњdisconcertingвЂќ, says Emily Mader at Cornell University in New York, who led the work.
In 2018, ticks were responsible for 47,743 reported cases of human disease in the US, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Lyme disease is the most common вЂ“ and in fact is the most common vector-borne disease in the US. вЂњBut there are many others that are less well known,вЂќ says Mader.
Some ticks can carry the Powassan virus, for example, which can cause encephalitis. вЂњIt has a high fatality rate,вЂќ says Mader. вЂњThose that do survive often have long-term issues because it attacks the nervous system.вЂќ

Mader and her colleagues surveyed 140 people working in the US on the control of vector-borne diseases, including academics and people at local, county and state public health and vector-control agencies. All participants were asked about their tick surveillance and control programmes, including how the prevalence of ticks is assessed, how ticks are screened for disease-causing pathogens and any difficulties teams encountered in undertaking these programmes.
Three-quarters of respondents said they had a programme to detect the presence of ticks, but only 26 per cent reported having an initiative to test ticks for potentially harmful pathogens. And only 12 per cent reported having a tick control programme in place.
вЂњUnfortunately, itвЂ™s a pretty patchy system across the country,вЂќ says Mader. вЂњThereвЂ™s no uniform approach to doing tick surveillance.вЂќ When asked, those who completed the survey вЂњuniversally said they need more fundingвЂќ, she says.
вЂњThe fact that we donвЂ™t know what pathogens are at what level in what ticks is worrisome,вЂќ says Dina Fonseca at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey. Without routine surveillance, we wonвЂ™t know which pathogens are responsible for human diseases or how to best advise people to protect themselves.
вЂњDifferent species of ticks act at different times of the day, in different places and you come into contact with them in different circumstances,вЂќ says Fonseca. вЂњThe guidelines are different for different species.вЂќ

Consistently funded tick surveillance plays a vital role in detecting new outbreaks of ticks and potential diseases. вЂњOne hotspot we found in 2017 let us know that there was an invasive tick in the country,вЂќ says Mader. After a woman found herself covered in ticks on her sheep farm, she went to her local mosquito control office. When the team performed genetic tests on the tick, they found it was native to Asia. The tick can reproduce asexually, so a single female can produce 3000 more ticks, quickly leading to an infestation, says Mader. вЂњIt has [since] been detected in 12 states.вЂќ
вЂњIf you donвЂ™t have that data, you canвЂ™t warn the public. You canвЂ™t tell them about the risk,вЂќ she says.

N1JS49CCH8,Bavarian Nordic Announces Topline Results from Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Equine Encephalitis Virus Vaccine,"Bavarian Nordic Announces Topline Results from Phase 1 Clinical Trial of Equine Encephalitis Virus Vaccine 
COPENHAGEN, Denmark, June 8, 2020 -- Bavarian Nordic A/S ( OMX: BAVA, OTC: BVNRY ) announced today topline results from the the first-in-human trial of MVA-BN В® WEV, a prophylactic vaccine candidate against three equine encephalitis viruses ( western, eastern and Venezuelan ), for which there are currently no preventative vaccines available. The Phase 1 trial, funded by the United States Department of Defense's ( DOD ) Joint Program Executive Office for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Defense's ( JPEO-CBRND ) Joint Project Manager for Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear Medical ( JPM CBRN Medical ) was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of MVA-BN WEV in 45 healthy adults in three treatment groups receiving different doses of the vaccine. All subjects were revaccinated after four weeks. Data from the study showed that the vaccine was well tolerated and immunogenic across all dose groups. Neutralizing antibody responses were observed in all dose groups, with peak levels reached after the second vaccination. Responses were detected as early as 2 weeks after the first vaccination in the highest dose group, in which also complete seroconversion was observed after the second vaccination. The most common vaccine-related adverse event was injection site pain. These clinically meaningful Phase 1 data warrant further clinical investigation, and Bavarian Nordic is currently in the process of obtaining additional funding from the U.S. authorities for the further clinical advancement of the vaccine candidate. `` We are pleased to report positive topline results from the first-in-human trial with our vaccine candidate against equine encephalitis viruses. A safe and effective vaccine against this fatal disease is a high priority for the U.S. government and we believe that our vaccine candidate is well positioned to meet these requirements. Our public-private partnership with the U.S. has previously shown the way for the successful development of vaccines against smallpox and Ebola, and we hope to continue the fruitful collaboration in this important disease area as well, '' said Paul Chaplin, President and Chief Executive Officer of Bavarian Nordic. About Equine Encephalitis Viruses. 
Eastern, Venezuelan and western equine encephalitis viruses belong to the family alphavirus, and are transmitted through mosquitos, as well as birds and some mammals. While the viruses vary in infection rates and severity of disease, all three pathogens are associated with risks of flu-like symptoms, potential central nervous disorders, and death. All three viruses are considered as potential biological threats, having been investigated as potential biological weapons at various times in the past century. The viruses belong to the U.S. list of prioritized pathogens amongst other agents, like smallpox, anthrax and other lethal diseases, which are covered by the current vaccination policy for U.S. military personnel being deployed around the globe. However, there are currently no approved vaccines for human use against any of the equine encephalitis viruses. Last year, the U.S. experienced the worst outbreak of Eastern equine encephalitis since monitoring of the disease began. According to the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ), 38 cases, including 15 deaths were reported in 2019, compared to an annual average of 7 cases over the past decade. The majority of cases occurred in northeastern parts of the U.S., where mosquitoes have been found to carry the virus. Federal funding acknowledgment.

7EHV4SOZJK,Researchers analyze data on RNA structure of tick-borne encephalitis virus,"Researchers analyze data on RNA structure of tick-borne encephalitis virus 
Researchers from Sechenov University together with colleagues from several Russian institutes analyzed data on the RNA structure of tick-borne encephalitis virus. 
Much larger than in previous studies, the data volume of the new study allowed them to estimate the age of the virus subtypes and track its spread in Eurasia. The results of the study were published in the journal Viruses. 
Tick-borne encephalitis is common in Central and Eastern Europe and a wide band in southern Siberia and the Far East. 
This disease is dangerous due to the ability of the virus to penetrate the brain and spinal cord, causing motor disorders, cognitive impairments and, in severe cases, paralysis and death. Every year in Russia, 1,500-2 ,000 people are infected, with about 30 % developing neurological complications and 20-100 people dying. 
The pathogen belongs to the genus Flavivirus ( it also includes Zika virus and the virus that causes dengue fever ) and is transmitted mainly through tick bites. There are three subtypes of the virus: Far Eastern, Siberian and European. 
Each of them is predominant in the region after which it is named, although this division is quite coarse - for example, cases of infection with the Siberian subtype were observed in the Baltic States and Sakhalin, and with the European one - in South Korea and the Altai Mountains. 
In recent years, the spread of the virus has expanded to northern areas ( Kola Peninsula, Arkhangelsk Region ) and mountainous regions ( in Central Europe and Italy ). In 2019, the first cases of infection were recorded in the UK and the Netherlands. 
To respond promptly to the emergence of the virus in new territories, it is necessary to understand what affects its spread and evolution. Existing studies provide different, sometimes contradictory results, but new data collected in recent years can clarify the situation. 
The authors of the article used Gen. 
Bank - a database that stores more than 200 million nucleotide sequences of RNA and DNA of various species. 
The data are supplied by scientists from different countries, and their volume is constantly growing, in common with the number of sequences describing the RNA of the tick-borne encephalitis virus - in ten years the number has increased fivefold. 
Using computer algorithms, researchers compared the RNA of viruses found in different years on the territory of several countries. 
Knowing the ` distance ' ( the proportion of divergent nucleotides ) between samples and the date of their receipt, one can estimate the time of divergence of species or the division of a species into subtypes. 
This method is based on the assumption that the sequence of nucleotides in a single species changes at an approximately constant rate, and is called the molecular clock. Using this method, scientists estimated the age of the most recent common ancestor for each of the subtypes. 
The result ( about 700 and 900 years for the Siberian and Far Eastern subtypes, respectively ) is consistent with earlier studies, while the age of the European subtype ( about 1,600 years ) was estimated for the first time after the virus was spotted in the Netherlands. 
The researchers also tried to find out how genetically similar viruses of the same subtype ended up in different countries at a distance of thousands of kilometres from each other. There are several possible explanations. 
First, viruses ( or ticks infected with them ) can travel long distances with animals, such as migratory birds or bats. Second, human activity can contribute to the spread of the virus: transportation of livestock or introduction of animals suitable for hunting in new territories. 

The most important result of the work was that most of the virus spreading events occurred in the last three or four centuries, and in many cases we have observed the transfer of the virus for thousands of kilometres in the last 50 - 100 years, and viruses in Europe have completely mixed over the last 100 - 200 years. ' 
Alexander Lukashev, Study Co-Author and Director of the Institute of Medical Parasitology and Tropical Medicine, Sechenov University 

` This allows us to consider tick-borne encephalitis as a highly dynamic disease, even as an emerging disease in many regions, and to think about an anthropogenic factor ( the spread of infected ticks as a result of transportation of domestic and wild animals ) as one of the main mechanisms behind the expansion of the virus. ' 
In addition, scientists have proposed an algorithm that simulates the compilation of samples as used in earlier studies. With its help, the authors of the article showed that the differences in results of previously published studies are well explained by the selection of the sequences included in the study.

The Office of Rospotrebnadzor in the Moscow Region reported Monday on tick activity in the region ( computer translated ). As of May 14, 2020, 1,417 people went to health providers in the Moscow Region for medical assistance regarding tick bite cases, 518 of them were children. For the same period in 2019, 3731 complaints were registered, including 1135 among children. 
Ixodes scapularis, a Black-legged tick/CDC 
For prophylactic purposes, people traveling to tick-borne viral encephalitis endemic areas, as well as people at occupational risk groups working in natural biotopes, are vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis. As of 05/14/2020, 1,119 people were vaccinated against tick-borne encephalitis, including 326 children. 
The results of laboratory studies of 353 ticks indicate the absence of tick-borne viral encephalitis pathogens in them. In 10 % of the studied ticks, pathogens of tick-borne tick-borne borreliosis were found, and in 3 % of human granulocytic anaplasmosis. 
In order to prevent infections transmitted by ixodid ticks, treatments were carried out in the area. 
Over the past 2020 period, 20 cases of Lyme disease were recorded, which corresponds to the same period in 2019. 
There were no cases of tick-borne viral encephalitis in the Moscow region.

U29GKHD0VS,"Maine Lyme disease: 'Providers are already reporting cases in 2020, and the number will rise as we enter the summer months'","By NewsDeskВ В @infectiousdiseasenewsВ 
The Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention (Maine CDC) reported a record more than 2,000 Lyme disease cases in 2019 and officials announce during this Lyme Disease Awareness Month that providers are already reporting cases in 2020, and the number will rise as we enter the summer months.
This has prompted health officials to advise the public to be aware of tick bites that transmit not only Lyme disease, but also anaplasmosis ( a bacterial disease), babesiosis (a parasitic disease) and Powassan virus. Individuals bitten by the deer tick can acquire more than one infection.
Many individuals and families are spending more time outdoors during the COVID-19 pandemic. This may put them at increased risk of exposure to tickborne pathogens.
Symptoms of anaplasmosis include: fever, headache, malaise and body aches. Symptoms of babesiosis include: extreme fatigue, aches, fever, chills, sweating, dark urine, and possibly anemia. Symptoms of Powassan include: fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, loss of coordination, speech difficulties, seizures, and encephalitis and meningitis.
In 2019, providers reported 685 cases of anaplasmosis, 138 cases of babesiosis and two cases of Powassan.
What to do after a tick bite:
вЂў Remove the tick properly, ideally using tweezers or a tick spoon.
вЂў Clean the area around the bite.
вЂў Instruct the patient to watch for signs and symptoms for 30 days.
вЂў Identify the tick and the engorgement level, or the amount of time the tick was attached.
вЂў Testing of the tick is not routinely recommended for clinical purposes because even if the tick
tests positive for Lyme, that does not mean it was attached long enough to transmit the disease.
Even if the tick tests negative that does not mean it was a patientвЂ™s only exposure.

The number of patients with confirmed COVID-19 in the Primorsky Region, in RussiaвЂ™s Far East, has risen by 52 over the past day to 1,007, the regional governmentвЂ™s press service reported on Wednesday.
""As of May 13, the number of those infected with the coronavirus in the Primorsky Region exceeded 1,000. Over the past day, the number of patients with COVID-19 has risen by 52. The regional crisis center reported that since the start of the epidemic some 1,007 residents of the region have been diagnosed with the coronavirus,"" the statement said.
Some fourteen patients in infectious disease hospitals remain in grave condition and they have been connected to lung ventilators. Forty-three patients are in serious condition, and 19 of them have complications related to the coronavirus.
Over the past day 28 people have been discharged from hospitals after successful treatment. The total number of coronavirus patients who recovered is estimated at 268.
Wearing face masks is compulsory in the region and self-isolation measures have been extended until June 1. A number of enterprises continue working in the region. Authorities in Nakhodka, which has reported the biggest number of COVID-19 cases, have introduced restrictions on entering or leaving the city.
In late December 2019, Chinese officials notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about the outbreak of a previously unknown pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, in central China. Since then, cases of the novel coronavirus - named COVID-19 by the WHO - have been reported in every corner of the globe, including Russia.
On March 11, 2020, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic. According to the latest statistics, over 4,269,000 people have been infected worldwide and more than 287,000 deaths have been reported. In addition, so far, over 1,534,000 individuals have recovered from the illness across the globe.
To date, a total of 232,243 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Russia, with 43,512 patients having recovered from the virus. RussiaвЂ™s latest data indicates 2,116 fatalities nationwide.

X1CV53IH8N,Atlanta Braves: Divisional shifts amid coronavirus pandemic 'not happening',"В© Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports
 The Atlanta Braves aren't interested in a solution to play the 2020 season that would have them playing in a Central Division.

In late April, Bob Nightengale of USA Today reported that Major League Baseball was considering shifting clubs to geographically-based divisions for a shortened 2020 season so games could occur during the coronavirus pandemic. Nightengale added that the Atlanta Braves would move to a Central division as part of the theoretical realignment. On Thursday, Braves chairman Terry McGuirk offered a retort to those rumors when speaking with Mark Bradley of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. ""That is not happening,"" McGuirk said. ""There is no possibility of that happening. It has never been discussed by Major League Baseball.""McGuirk continued: ""We live in the East. We play in the East. Our travel will be in the East. WeвЂ™re an Eastern division team, and thatвЂ™s where weвЂ™ll stay.""He did, however, admit that concerns about travel could alter a schedule that's been affected by the virus outbreak since March.В Earlier this week, former MLB player Trevor Plouffe and Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic reported on the possibility that some sort of season could get underway on July 1. Neither the league nor the MLB Players Association offered official comments on those rumors, nor have the parties announced an agreement for the resumption of spring training activities.В On Wednesday, Boston Red Sox pitcher Collin McHugh spoke out against the idea of playing amid the pandemic.В Subscribe to Yardbarker's Morning Bark, the most comprehensive newsletter in sports.

X412HHNXIO,Coronavirus patient dies in Far Eastern Russian region of Primorsky,"VLADIVOSTOK, April 7. /TASS/. A patient with confirmed novel coronavirus infection has died in a hospital in RussiaвЂ™s Far Eastern region of Primorsky, the regional governmentвЂ™s press service said on Tuesday.
""The second novel coronavirus patient has died in the Primorsky region. It was a 62-year-old resident of the town of Arsenyev [about 160 kilometers northeast of the regionвЂ™s administrative center, Vladivostok], who returned from Egypt in mid-March,"" the press service said in a statement.
""The man returned on March 18 and, as a person who arrived from a country with an unfavorable COVID-19 situation, was immediately placed under medical supervision, to an infectious hospital,"" the statement says.
According to regional authorities, the patient was regularly tested for the virus, but his test came back positive only on March 27. The patient subsequently developed pneumonia, and all doctorsвЂ™ efforts to save him produced no result.
As of Tuesday, three persons in the region are awaiting for final confirmation of their COVID-19 status. As of 09:00 local time (2:00 Moscow time) on Tuesday, no new cases of the disease have been reported in the region.
More than 8,000 residents remain in self-isolation under medical supervision. Over 200 people have been quarantined in medical facilities. Some 9,000 novel coronavirus tests have been made.
In total, eight cases of the novel coronavirus infection have been confirmed in the Primorsky region so far. Two of the patients died and two recovered and were discharged from hospital. Four people are still receiving their treatment.
Starting from Tuesday, an e-pass system was introduced for doctors, pharmacists, rescuers and other residents who have to travel around the regionвЂ™s administrative center of Vladivostok to fulfill their professional duties.
As of April 6, a total of 6,343 coronavirus cases have been confirmed in Russia. As many as 406 patients have recovered. According to data as of 10:30 Moscow time, forty-seven patients died. Two more deaths were reported from St. Petersburg and the Irkutsk region, however these data are yet to be verified by the federal anti-coronavirus crisis center.

1IRUJHV4C3,China Gives Russia Coronavirus Aid,"Even as the world struggles with the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, geopolitical maneuvering continues. China has seized the outbreak as an opportunity to lend a very public hand to countries now battling the disease. Already Beijing has promised or delivered humanitarian aid to countries ranging from Estonia to Iran, from Pakistan to Spain.
Now, China has even begun to direct aid to those who have slighted the country in recent months. Russia made China and its citizens (and, sometimes, anyone who looked Chinese) the primary targets in the battle to contain the coronavirus. Not only did China turn out to be the wrong target, but the move endangered the KremlinвЂ™s most reliable strategic alliance. But China seems to have forgiven RussiaвЂ”or seems to value their relationship more highly than any slight.

When the new coronavirus first broke out, RussiaвЂ™s main vulnerability seemed to be its 2,600-mile-long land border with China, the first epicenter of the pandemic. In January, the Kremlin moved with surprising speed to shut that border, becoming one of the first countries to introduce a blanket ban on all Chinese visitors. Until recently, it looked like this strategy was working. At the beginning of last week, there were only 438 confirmed coronavirus cases in Russia among a population of 146 million. But that was before a sudden surge brought the number to 1,836 cases and nine deaths as of March 30.
Russian measures directed against China werenвЂ™t limited to border closings. In Moscow, thousands of miles west of the Russo-Chinese border, bus drivers as well as tram and metro conductors were purportedly ordered by the cityвЂ™s state-owned transport operator to monitor any Chinese passengers. Drivers were reportedly even told to call the police if they had any вЂњpersons of Chinese nationalityвЂќ in their vehicles.
It turns out, however, that Russia wasnвЂ™t importing its coronavirus cases directly from China, but via Europe. No place better illustrates this than Khabarovsk, one of the largest cities in the Russian Far East. Located just 20 miles away from the Chinese border, Khabarovsk now has eight confirmed cases of the coronavirus. With the border closed, none of the cases came from ChinaвЂ”instead, at least five have been traced to Russian citizens who had recently visited Europe.
[Mapping the Coronavirus Outbreak: Get daily updates on the pandemic and learn how itвЂ™s affecting countries around the world.]
The Khabarovsk cases have laid bare the faulty logic of RussiaвЂ™s coronavirus containment strategy. Even as Chinese citizens were turned away, flights from Spain and ItalyвЂ”the European hot spots of the pandemicвЂ”continued to enter Russia unhindered. One reason for this preferential treatment of European nations during the crisis is that Russia continues to view itself as a European nation, despite its strategic shift to Asia. (Indeed, Moscow seized the opportunity to remind Rome of their historic ties by sending a military convoy carrying medical specialists and equipment to Italy.)
RussiaвЂ™s treatment of China did not go unnoticed in Beijing. On Feb. 25, tensions came to a head in the form of a rare diplomatic spat between the Chinese Embassy in Moscow and the local authorities. The embassy sent a letter to the Moscow city government, asking it to end what the embassy said was discrimination against Chinese citizens on public transportation. Such measures were unbefitting of an ally, the letter warned, and вЂњdo not exist in any country, even the United States and Western countries.вЂќ
Despite these tensions, personal relations between Chinese President Xi Jinping and his вЂњbest and bosomвЂќ friend, Russian President Vladimir Putin, appear to be unaffected. On March 19, during their first official phone call since the virus outbreak, Putin was quick to flatter Xi, denouncing U.S. President Donald TrumpвЂ™s insistence on using the term вЂњChinese virusвЂќ while commending ChinaвЂ™s вЂњremarkably efficientвЂќ handling of the crisis. For Putin, China has become more important since Russia invaded Ukraine and annexed Crimea in 2014. Since then, China and Russia have accelerated cooperation between their governments, economies, and militaries. Official and diplomatic contact operates smoothly.
This bonhomie has failed to materialize on the ground, however. The Chinese are at best ambivalent about their Russian neighbors, and Russians often openly express hostility toward their Chinese counterparts. Ordinary Chinese and Russians, it seems, do not share Xi and PutinвЂ™s personal chemistry. The virus has exposed this fragility: In February, the Levada Center, an independent Russian polling organization, published data showing that since the outbreak, the share of Russians who view China negatively has grown from 18 percent to 24 percent. Sinophobia is more common among RussiaвЂ™s population than its leaders admit, particularly in the Russian Far East.
Khabarovsk is a good example. When the cityвЂ™s main news website published a story that said 24 Chinese citizens were under quarantine in a specialized zone, readersвЂ™ comments described them as parasites who feed off the Russian state. This runs in stark contrast to the Russian state mediaвЂ™s narrative of an вЂњunbreakable bondвЂќ between the two countries.
In reality, it is KhabarovskвЂ™s economy that is dependent upon China. As a result of the virus, the cityвЂ™s tourism and services sectors are already in a dire state. Prior to the border closing, approximately 45,000 Chinese organized tours had been expected to travel to Russia in March alone. If the restrictions are not lifted before summer, tour operators are expected to lose $400 million. Even before COVID-19, attracting non-Chinese visitorsвЂ”even ones from other parts of RussiaвЂ”to Khabarovsk was an uphill battle. Replacing these tourism revenues with other income is now nearly impossible and will require support from the Kremlin.
Compounding these economic problems, Khabarovsk is experiencing a severe shortage of medical-grade masks after speculators stockpiled them last month. Reports also suggest that the Russian elites in Moscow are hoarding urgently needed ventilators for personal use. As late as early March, KhabarovskвЂ™s branch of the Russian Red Cross was still collecting medical equipment to dispatch to Heilongjiang province just across the borderвЂ”leading to the collection of a modest 56 boxes of supplies. At the national level, Russian support for China included 25 tons of medical equipment flown into Wuhan.

Now, however, it is Russia that is ramping up the emergency response and in dire need of help. Russia is now accepting aid from China. During a phone call with his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi pledged on March 18 that the Chinese government will promptly provide necessary assistance to Russia. On March 19, Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin declared the suspension of all customs restrictions for one month. On the following day, China shipped its first batch of face masks to Russia.
ChinaвЂ™s lifeline to Russia wonвЂ™t be limited to medical assistance. As RussiaвЂ™s economy falters amid the escalating pandemic, trade with China will become even more important to cities like Khabarovsk along the Russo-Chinese border.
The flow of aid from China to Russia suggests Beijing has forgiven its allyвЂ”at least for now. But the long-term consequences of the coronavirus crisis for their partnership are less clear. When a Russian reporter asked ChinaвЂ™s ambassador to Russia, Zhang Hanhui, to comment on RussiaвЂ™s assistance to China at the beginning of the pandemic, he said Russian support had been вЂњsincere, timely, solid, and comprehensive.вЂќ Diplomatic niceties aside, China is unlikely to forget that its most important strategic partner cannot be relied on in times of need.",https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/04/01/china-russia-coronavirus-aid-forgiveness-diplomacy/,#,,20/12/2020 20:00,2020-04-01 05:00:00+00:00,ee94b68e6e0f,foreignpolicy.com,,1585724400,EN

WQQOHU6CYU,No sick ticks yet,"No sick ticks yet 
Tick season has officially started, but none of the nine ticks that have been tested so far have been found to be carrying any diseases, according to Latvian Centre of Infectious Diseases Head Doctor Baiba RozentДЃle. 

The first to notify the center of tick activity have been dog owners. So far there have been no new patients suffering from tick-borne encephalitis or lyme disease, but people should still make sure they are vaccinated against encephalitis. 

`` A person needs to look at their vaccination passport and check if it's not time to go for a revaccination. But that's only against ticks with the encephalitis virus, which causes tick-borne encephalitis, but against lyme disease there is no vaccine, '' said RozentДЃle. 

Last year out of the more than 6,000 ticks inspected, only one percent had the encephalitis virus, but every fourth or fifth had the borrelia bacterium that causes lyme disease. Many people may think a walk in nature is a great way to get exercise while social distancing during the pandemic, but people should still use precautions such as tick repellent, and wear long sleeves and pants.

Three federal cities вЂ”В Moscow, St. Petersburg and Sevastopol вЂ”В have declared a state of high alert, as well as all regions in the Far East, Siberia, the Urals, the Volga River basin, the countryвЂ™s south and northwest. The Oryol and Tver regions in central Russia, and three out of seven regions in North Caucasus (the Ingushetia and Karachay-Circassian regions and Chechnya) have not yet declared the regime.
A state of high alert means that all public events will be postponed and the number of people participating in authorized events will be reduced. In addition, people are recommended to refrain from traveling abroad, while employers are obliged to keep personnel with symptoms of infectious disease from coming to work. Schools and universities have moved to remote learning.
Coronavirus pandemic

In late December 2019, Chinese authorities notified the World Health Organization (WHO) about the outbreak of a previously unknown pneumonia in the city of Wuhan, central China. Since then, cases of the novel coronavirus вЂ”В named COVID-19 by the WHO вЂ”В have been reported in more than 170 countries, including Russia.
On March 11, the WHO declared the outbreak a global pandemic. As of now, over 210,000 people have been infected around the world and about 8,500 have died. Russia has identified 147 cases as yet.

4VP0MVBHCZ,Russian Parliament Paves Way For Vladimir Putin to Remain in Power Until 2036,"Here is todayвЂ™s Foreign Policy brief: Russia paves way for Putin to stay on as president, Britain slashes interest rates as U.S. President Trump attacks the Fed and weighs an economic stimulus, and the latest on the coronavirus.
If you would like to receive Morning Brief in your inbox every weekday, please sign up here.

On Tuesday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said he would approve newly-proposed changes to the Russian constitution that would allow him to remain in power until 2036. Under the current constitution, Putin would be required to step down when his term ends in 2024, and speculation was rife about what Putin would do next.
Valentina Tereshkova, a member of parliament for the ruling United Russia party, proposed the surprise constitutional amendment that would reset PutinвЂ™s presidential term count to zero.
Is it all a done deal? As Reid Standish reports in Foreign Policy, the decision вЂњhas not eliminated ambiguity about the KremlinвЂ™s course of action. Rather, the dramatic move is widely seen as part of an effort to create options for the Russian leader.вЂќ Notably, Putin was not definitive as to whether he would continue as president, telling RussiaвЂ™s parliament, вЂњIвЂ™m sure that together, we will do many more great things, at least until 2024. Then, we will see.вЂќ
What happens next? In approving of the amendment proposal, Putin said that any such move would need to be voted on in a public referendum. Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a Russia expert the Center for a New American Security and former intelligence officer at the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that a vote, floated for April 22, would come at an opportune time for the measure to pass. вЂњThereвЂ™s now less time for the opposition to organize against it. You also have the confluence of the coronavirus outbreak, which makes it easier for authorities to ban mass gatherings,вЂќ she said.

What WeвЂ™re Following Today

U.S. stocks rebound as Trump weighs stimulus. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrial average both rose by just under 5 percent in a late rally after MondayвЂ™s plunge of nearly 8 percent. The gains came as U.S. President Donald Trump said he would take вЂњmajor stepsвЂќ to stimulate the economy, including a payroll tax cut. On Twitter, President Trump pressured the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, calling it вЂњpatheticвЂќ and saying competing nations have as much as a вЂњtwo point advantageвЂќ over the United States at present.
Interests rates cut in Britain. On Wednesday morning, the Bank of England announced an emergency interest rate cut of 0.5 percentвЂ”from 0.75 percent to 0.25 percent, a record low for Britain. The cut is the first since August 2016, when rates briefly declined to 0.25 percent before being raised back to 0.5 percent a few months later. The bankвЂ™s Monetary Policy Committee voted unanimously in favor of the move on Tuesday, along with other relief measures for small businesses.
Foreign PolicyвЂ™s Keith Johnson reports on the limits of economic remedies in tackling the impacts of the coronavirus.
Big Tuesday Results. Joe Biden continued his quest to become the Democratic partyвЂ™s nominee for president with a strong showing in six states. Biden took the top prize, Michigan, defeating his rival Sen. Bernie Sanders by a margin of 53 percent to 37 percent according to preliminary results.

Italy continues its attempts to contain the outbreak at home. Meanwhile, Austria and Slovenia have closed their borders with the country, but those of France and Switzerland remain open. Yesterday, ItalyвЂ™s Deputy Finance Minister Laura Castelli confirmed that mortgage payments would be temporarily frozen for individuals and households. ItalyвЂ™s death toll from the coronavirus outbreak jumped 36 percent from 366 to 463, making it the worst-hit country after China.
JapanвЂ™s government announced $4 billion in spending to mitigate the economic effects of coronavirus and improve medical facilities. Finance Minister Taro Aso said the funds would come from an existing budget reserve and not from any extra budget. According to the Wall Street Journal, the measures include offering emergency zero-interest loans of $1,900 to support the newly unemployed and others facing hardship.
South Korea has seen a decrease in reported cases of coronavirus for the fourth consecutive day. The country still has 7,513 confirmed cases but has managed to slow the outbreak with aggressive measures, such as free testing and setting up drive-through rapid testing stations.
British Health Minister Nadine Dorries has tested positive for COVID-19 and is self-isolating at home. Her diagnosis has prompted worries about the virus spreading in Parliament and at Downing Street, where Dorries attended a reception with Prime Minister Boris Johnson a few days ago. Although some have called for shutting down Parliament as a precaution, Johnson has shown no intention of doing so.
Chinese President Xi Jinping made a visit to Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province, where the outbreak began and the vast majority of coronavirus-related deaths have occurred. His appearance on Tuesday was a show of confidence in ChinaвЂ™s ability to handle the outbreak, and comes after Chinese officials reported on Monday that only 17 new cases were reported in Hubei. As the virus epicenter, mainland China has been worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with over 80,000 confirmed cases so far.
Beijing continues to censor coronavirus whistleblowers. As China celebrates the decline in cases, it is also stepping up censorship of whistleblowers calling attention to BeijingвЂ™s botched early response to the disease. Ai Fen, Wuhan Central HospitalвЂ™s director of emergency medicine, gave an interview to the Chinese magazine Renwu, chronicling how she discovered one of the first confirmed cases after seeing lab test results on Dec. 30 and shared a photo of the results with colleaguesвЂ”and how she was subsequently reprimanded for spreading rumors.
вЂњIf I had known what was to happen, I would not have cared about the reprimand. I would have fucking talked about it to whoever, wherever I could,вЂќ she said in the interview, which has now been erased from the Chinese internet. Readers have scrambled to preserve it through screenshots and transliteration into emojis, morse code, and pinyin.
What is driving the coronavirus panic? Foreign Policy Editor in Chief Jonathan Tepperman lays out the three overarching reasons why this crisis is different.

South African court clears Ramaphosa. The high court in Pretoria has cleared South African President Cyril Ramaphosa after he stood accused of misleading parliament over a $34,000 campaign contribution from the CEO of a local company. ItвЂ™s a rare boost for Ramaphosa, who is presiding over a recession in South Africa and whose leadership of the ruling African National Congress is in question ahead of a July party conference, where his internal opponents may seek to recall him.В 
Turkey Patriot deal. Turkish officials said that the United States is open to renewing a deal on Patriot missile systems as well as returning Turkey to the F-35 fighter jet program in return for Turkey backing out of its air defense deal with Russia. The deal appears to hinge on whether the United States will agree to terms on joint production and knowledge transfer. If no deal is made with the United States, Turkey plans to activate its Russian-made S-400 systems next month.
Irish rivals seek coalition. Four weeks after the Irish general election delivered a stalemate, long-standing rivals Fianna Fail and Fine Gael have announced they are entering talks to form a government. If talks are successful, it would be the first time the two parties would share power in IrelandвЂ™s history. ItвЂ™s also likely to be a weak coalition, as both parties combined do not have enough seats for a majority.

Foreign Policy Recommends

When two protesters were killed in Hong Kong, it made headlines around the world. Over 600 people have been killed over the past five months in ongoing anti-government protests in Iraq, and it has barely scratched the surface of the news cycle. The journalist and illustrator Andrew North reports from Baghdad for Tortoise Media about how IraqвЂ™s post-Saddam Hussein generation is facing down tear gas and gunfire as they call for new elections, an end to U.S. and Iranian interference, and a way to overcome the ethnic and religious divides that have driven the countryвЂ™s politics. вЂ“Amy Mackinnon

In France, the mayor of the small town of Landerneau that played host to a gathering of 3,500 people dressed as Smurfs over the weekend has defended of the event, which had come under fire over fears it could spread the coronavirus. вЂњWe must not stop living вЂ¦ it was the chance to say that we are alive,вЂќ Mayor Patrick Leclerc told AFP.

TIWGEINIBT,Almost half of deer ticks carry Lyme disease: New study,"Almost half of deer ticks carry Lyme disease: New study 
Nearly half of more than 2,000 deer ticks collected last year for a new study in Connecticut were infected with Lyme disease. Of 2,068 deer ticks tested at the Center for Vector Biology and Zoonotic Diseases at the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station in New Haven, Connecticut, 46 percent carry the Lyme disease pathogen Borrelia burgdorferi. About 13 percent also carried the human disease-causing pathogen Babesia microti, which causes babesia, a life-threatening infection of the red blood cells in humans. Researchers found that 9 percent of the adult ticks carried Anaplasma phagocytophilum, which causes anaplasmosis, which is marked by fever, headache, chills and muscle aches; 2 percent carried Borrelia miyamotoi, which cause hard tick relapsing fever, bacterial infection that can cause recurring bouts of fever, headache, muscle and joint aches and nausea; and 1 percent carried Powassan virus, which can cause Powassan encephalitis, which produces symptoms of fever, headache, vomiting and weakness, and can lead to encephalitis ) meningitis. The ticks were gathered in the first year of a new federally funded Connecticut-wide surveillance program for ticks and associated tick-borne diseases. More than 2,500 ticks were collected throughout spring, summer and fall 2019 from 40 publicly accessible locations in all eight Connecticut counties and screened for five different human disease-causing pathogens. Deer ticks, also known as black-legged ticks, were the most collected species, at 2,068 adult ticks, followed by American dog tick, at 437; lone star tick, at 3; and Asian longhorned tick, at 2. All adult female and nymphal deer ticks were tested at CAES for the presence of the five different disease-causing pathogens. About 15 percent of the nymphs carried Lyme disease, 6 percent carried babesiosis, 5 percent carried anaplasmosis and 2 percent carried hard tick relapsing fever. The survey was funded by a one-year grant issued from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through the Connecticut Department of Public Health and has potential to continue into a multi-year effort to document tick and pathogen abundances statewide to inform the public so appropriate precautions are taken when spending time outdoors.

TFTUKSRSOC,Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine scheme expands,"Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine scheme expands 
Ticks carrying TBE are spreading. 

Image: Yle 

The Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare ( THL ) will expand Finland's national vaccine programme against tick-borne encephalitis ( TBE ) in 2020 to include new regions where coverage is most needed. Some islands in Lake Lohja in southern Finland will be added to the vaccination scheme, as well as the municipality of Kustavi in western Finland, where cases of the potentially deadly disease have risen for the past five years running. Free TBE vaccines continue to be available in Г…land, Parainen and Simo, southern Kemi, the Kotka archipelago, Sammonlahti in Lappeenranta and Preiskari island near Raahe.

Paula Collin / Yle, Tanja Ylitalo / Yle 

This vaccination measure only works against TBE -- it does not prevent the contraction of Lyme disease and it does nothing to repel ticks themselves, despite unclear marketing of the service and imprecise branding as a `` tick vaccine ''. Anti-TBE vaccines have been part of Finland's national vaccine programme since THL instated the service in Г…land in 2006. Other regions were added to the scheme in 2017 ( Parainen, Simo ), 2018 ( Kemi, Lappeenranta, Kotka ) and 2019 ( Lohja ). THL: Cases in 20 percent of municipalitiesTHL reported 69 TBE cases last year. That was down from 79 cases in 2018 and 82 cases the year before that. `` Expanding the programme and developing local vaccine recommendations has probably helped to bring the number down, '' said THL researcher Sari Huusko. Tracking statistics since 2015 show TBE disease incidence to be highest in the seaside town of Parainen, with 53 cases per 100,000 inhabitants. Last year, nine cases were reported there. Other high-incidence regions included Simo ( 42/100K ), Kustavi ( 30/100K ) and Г…land ( 28/100K ). There were no cases of tick-borne encephalitis reported at all in some 80 percent of Finland's municipalities between 2015 and 2019. Theory: Watery hotspots. 
Tick expert Jani Sormunen from the University of Turku said he is not surprised that the THL opted to broaden the scope of its vaccine coverage. Story continues after photo 

Sormunen collecting specimens last autumn.

`` There are strong indications in Finland and the other Nordic countries that ticks have proliferated greatly during the past two decades. Incidence is expected to spread to more regions, '' Sormunen said. As to why incidence is so much higher in certain places than the rest of the country, Sormunen said it is a mystery. `` Risk regions appear to follow bodies of water. A waterway may form a physical barrier for host mammals in the wild, preventing them from travelling or gathering in groups on the shore. ''

Paula Collin / Yle, Tanja Ylitalo / Yle 

Another theory is that large bodies of water even out extreme weather fluctuations, affecting the activity and survival of ticks in their larval stage, a crucial stage in the spread of the virus. This exceptionally warm winter may raise tick populations in Southern Finland as mammals survive better, Sormunen said, but sufficient data is still needed to make predictions. There has been no winter this warm in the THL tick record, as tracking began in the 2010s. `` A few winters ago there were freezing temperatures but no snow. The frost went in deep and killed a lot of the arthropods in the earth, but it had no effect on the tick population at all. So it may be that this warm winter wo n't have an effect this summer either, '' Sormunen said.",https://yle.fi/uutiset/osasto/news/tick-borne_encephalitis_vaccine_scheme_expands/11238433,"Southern Finland, southern Finland, western Finland, southern Kemi, near Raahe",,16/09/2020 09:25,2020-03-03 07:00:00+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,yle.fi,,1583222400,EN

A report on the situation and measures will be made within three days, '' the statement said. 
The Central Television of China said earlier that the number of confirmed cases of pneumonia caused by coronavirus in China has increased to 1,372 people. Thus, according to data as of Saturday, the number of people infected with the virus increased to 1,372 people, the number of deaths did not change and reached 41. 
China's National Health Commission said earlier that the Chinese authorities have sent 1,230 doctors to the city of Wuhan in the central province of Hubei closed over a novel coronavirus outbreak to help local health institutions fight the deadly infection. 
`` China's National Health Commission has formed six teams numbering a total of 1,230 specialists to render medical assistance to medics in Wuhan, '' the document says. 
`` Also, six back-up teams have been formed, which are ready to go Wuhan, if necessary, '' the statement says. 
China's news agency Xinhua reported on Saturday that 450 military doctors specializing in respiratory and infectious diseases and infection control in intensive care units had arrived in Wuhan by decision of the country's Central Military Commission. Some of them have the experience of fighting the SARS ( Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, also known as atypical pneumonia ) and the Ebola hemorrhagic fever. 
As China's National Health Commission reported on Saturday, the death toll from the coronavirus outbreak in the country has reached 41. The number of infected people has risen to 1,287, including 237 in a severe condition. A total of 15,197 people have come into close contact with the infected persons, of whom 1,230 have been screened and discharged and 13,967 are under medical observation. 
The Chinese authorities informed the World Health Organization ( WHO ) on December 31, 2019 about the outbreak of pneumonia of unknown origin in Wuhan, a large trade and industrial center with a population of over 11 million people. The pathogen, the 2019 - n. 
CoV coronavirus, was identified on January 7. 
The novel coronavirus cases have also been reported in Australia, Vietnam, South Korea, Singapore, the United States, Thailand, France and Japan.

POF24O0UT0,Breaking Down the 2019 Eastern Equine Encephalitis Outbreak in the US,"Eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus made a comeback in the United States in 2019. The mosquito-borne illness landed on ContagionВ®вЂ™s list of top infectious disease outbreaks for the year.EEE has been existence for centuries and 12 US-based epidemics were recorded between 1831 and 1959. Between 2003-18, an average of 8 EEE cases were reported annually in humans, but annual case counts rose dramatically in 2019.The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) refers to the virus as the cause of вЂњone of the most severe arboviral diseases in North America.вЂќ The latest issue of the CDCвЂ™s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report features more details on the 2019 outbreak in the United States.As of October 15, 2019, 34 cases of EEE were reported to the CDC from 7 states. The highest number of cases were reported from Massachusetts.CDC authors note that the virus usually presents as a systemic febrile illness but often leads to neurologic disease. The neuroinvasive disease has an estimated case fatality rate of 30% and half of survivors typically experience neurologic sequelae.Among the 34 patients, 32 (94%) were diagnosed with encephalitis and 2 (6%) were diagnosed with meningitis. All patients were hospitalized and 12 (35%) died as a result.According to the report, the onset of illnesses ranged from June 18вЂ”September 20, 2019. The majority of illness symptoms (62%) were detected in August.Available information on the affected indicates that 26 (76) of patients were male. Patients ranged in age from 5-78 years with a median age of 64 years. Among the fatal cases, 10 (83%) of patients were male and the median age was 72 years. Deaths occurred a median of 12 days after onset of illness.The authors report that the case-fatality ratio was 64% among individuals aged >70 years and was 22% among younger individuals.вЂњThe risk for human infection in a given year depends on multiple factors, including weather, abundance of birds and mosquitoes that can transmit the virus, human behavior, and clinical awareness and diagnostic testing practices,вЂќ the authors write, indicating that it is not clear why a high number cases were recorded in 2019.Currently, there are no available antiviral drugs or vaccines that are safe and effective against EEE. At this point in time, patients with EEE are treated with supportive care including intensive care and ventilator assistance. Social support and counseling are recommended for the patient and their family members due to the serious, and sometimes long-term, effects of the infection.The report recommends that providers operating in areas at risk for EEE transmission should consider the mosquito-borne infection when aseptic meningitis and encephalitis are observed and proceed by obtaining appropriate serum or cerebrospinal fluid specimens for testing.If a case is suspected, providers are instructed to report it to their state or local health department and send the specimen to confirm diagnosis. In the event of a suspected case, state and local officials may implement vector control to reduce the risk of further transmission.вЂњBecause human vaccines against EEEV are not available, prevention depends on community and household efforts to reduce vector populations (eg, applying insecticides and reducing breeding sites) and personal protective measures to decrease exposure to mosquitoes (eg, use of repellents and wearing protective clothing),вЂќ the authors conclude.",https://www.contagionlive.com/news/breaking-down-the-2019-eastern-equine-encephalitis-outbreak-in-the-us,North America,,09/10/2020 10:30,2020-01-20 07:00:00+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,www.contagionlive.com,,1579507200,EN

Abstract and Introduction 
Abstract 
During February 2018 -- January 2019, we conducted large-scale surveillance for the presence and prevalence of tick-borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) and louping ill virus ( LIV ) in sentinel animals and ticks in the United Kingdom. Serum was collected from 1,309 deer culled across England and Scotland. Overall, 4 % of samples were ELISA-positive for the TBEV serocomplex. A focus in the Thetford Forest area had the highest proportion ( 47.7 % ) of seropositive samples. Ticks collected from culled deer within seropositive regions were tested for viral RNA; 5 of 2,041 ticks tested positive by LIV/TBEV real-time reverse transcription PCR, all from within the Thetford Forest area. From 1 tick, we identified a full-length genomic sequence of TBEV. Thus, using deer as sentinels revealed a potential TBEV focus in the United Kingdom. This detection of TBEV genomic sequence in UK ticks has important public health implications, especially for undiagnosed encephalitis. 

Introduction 
The only tickborne flavivirus in the United Kingdom documented to cause disease in vertebrates is louping ill virus ( LIV ), a vivirus transmitted by the deer/sheep tick, Ixodes ricinus. [ 1 ] This tick species is the most abundant and widely distributed tick species in the United Kingdom and a known vector of Lyme borreliosis. LIV is most commonly detected in sheep, cattle, and red grouse and has been reported in Scotland, Wales, and England ( primarily Cumbria, Devon, and North Yorkshire ). [ 1 ] Humans are incidental hosts for LIV, and infection has been reported infrequently; в‰€ 45 clinical cases have been linked to encephalitis during the past 85 years. [ 1,2 ] However, the short window of acute infection leads to uncertainty about whether suspected cases resulted from LIV infection or some other cause, although serologic analysis to analyze recent exposure through induction of IgM-specific responses, in combination with clinical symptoms, could inform a presumptive diagnosis. Human cases are mostly linked to occupational exposure, particularly in abattoir or farm workers and occasionally in laboratory staff. [ 2 ] Although the UK Animal and Plant Health Agency holds a database of confirmed diagnoses of LIV in livestock, [ 3,4 ] the distribution and regional prevalence of LIV has not been fully defined. Records of distribution and regional prevalence are based on voluntary submissions by farmers and veterinarians from symptomatic livestock, [ 1 ] from which private submissions are not integrated. Serologic analysis has been complicated; some animals received vaccination before its withdrawal. 
Tick-borne encephalitis virus ( TBEV ) is a closely related flavivirus that, although known to be less virulent than LIV for sheep, [ 5 ] causes a neurologic disease ( tick-borne encephalitis [ TBE ] ) after transmission to humans by infected ticks, producing clinical disease in an estimated one third of TBEV infections. [ 6 ] TBE typically has a biphasic course starting with a prodromal phase with influenza-like symptoms, followed by a symptom-free interval before neurologic disease occurs; neurologic disease ranges from mild meningitis to severe encephalitis with or without myelitis and spinal paralysis. [ 7 ] Three classic subtypes of TBEV are recognized: European ( TBEV-Eu ), Siberian, and Far Eastern. Two additional TBEV subtypes have recently been proposed: Baikalian subtype and the Himalayan subtype. [ 8 ] TBEV-Eu is the prevailing subtype in Western Europe where it is primarily transmitted by I. ricinus ticks and is maintained within forest and meadow biotypes in endemic foci. In the United Kingdom, TBE is considered an imported disease; opportunities for the virus to become established principally are limited because the UK climate was not thought to support the specific conditions required for enzoonotic cycles to be established for TBEV to become endemic. [ 9 ] However, changes in climate have affected the emergence, distribution, and abundance of I. ricinus in the United Kingdom; [ 10 ] thus, the risk for tickborne disease has increased. [ 11 ] A recent study provided evidence that co-infestation of tick larvae and nymphs occurs in small mammals in UK woodland. [ 12 ] The increasing range of TBEV in Western Europe was underscored recently when the Netherlands reported its first human case in 2016. [ 13 ] Moreover, retrospective serologic screening of deer serum samples and molecular analysis of questing ticks found evidence of TBEV circulation in the Netherlands as far back as 2010 and 2015. [ 13,14 ] Given the increasing possibility that TBEV could be circulating in the United Kingdom, Public Health England developed a surveillance program focusing on wild animals and ticks. 

In TBEV-endemic areas in continental Europe, the prevalence of TBEV in questing ticks is low, rarely exceeding 1 % even in regions where the incidence of human infections is high. [ 15 ] Therefore, instead of screening ticks directly, we used sentinel animals first to identify serologic evidence of TBEV to highlight sites for focused tick testing by specific TBEV detection using real-time reverse transcription PCR ( rRT-PCR ). Deer are proven as reliable sentinels for identifying areas where TBEV is present [ 13,15 ] because they have a limited home range, are available in large numbers, and are broadly dispersed within the surveillance areas. They also show long-lasting antibody responses after natural exposure to flaviviruses. [ 15,16 ] 

For our study, collectors retrieved blood samples from deer culled in England and Scotland during February 2018 -- January 2019; when available, they also collected tick samples. We tested the blood samples for TBEV or LIV antibodies and the ticks for the presence of viral RNA by rRT-PCR.",https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/923080,"Western Europe, North Yorkshire",,16/09/2020 09:25,2020-01-15 04:11:02+00:00,de27fa2ff4a5,www.medscape.com,,1579065062,EN
